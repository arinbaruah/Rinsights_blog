    "text": "Hi ! I am Arindam Baruah, a graduate student of Business Analytics at Monash Business School, Monash University. With a keen interest and salient experiences in the field of analytics, I am intrigued by the patterns which can be uncovered through data visualisations and some very interesting mathematics. I focus on implementing data science concepts to real-world problems and have successfully implemented them for predicting various estimates in the field of manufacturing.\nMy studies generally span over various fields and I am constantly in the hunt to uncover more scenarios which would let me harness the power of analytics to automate various tasks and allow me to gain meaningful insights post analysis.\nAs part of my coursework, I analyse and visualise data, mostly in R or python. I am currently developing an application for studying the diversity among the PhD graduates in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor interests\n\n\n\nStatistics, Data analytics in the manufacturing industry and formula 1, Machine learning, Steel manufacturing.\n\n\n\nRecent publications\n\nOptimised machine learning classification model to detect void formations in friction stir welding. Link\nNumerically modelled study of the plunge stage in friction stir spot welding using multi-tiered mesh partitions. Link"
