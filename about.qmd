Hi ! I am Arindam Baruah, a graduate student of Business Analytics at [Monash Business School](https://github.com/arinbaruah), Monash University. With a keen interest and salient experiences in the field of analytics, I am intrigued by the patterns which can be uncovered through data visualisations and some very interesting mathematics. I focus on implementing data science concepts to real-world problems and have successfully implemented them for predicting various estimates in the field of manufacturing.

# Major interests

**Statistics, Data analytics in the manufacturing industry and formula 1, Machine learning, Steel manufacturing.**
:::

My studies generally span over various fields and I am constantly in the hunt to uncover more scenarios which would let me harness the power of analytics to automate various tasks and allow me to gain meaningful insights post analysis.

After studying a specialisation in the field of metallurgy and manufacturing engineering at IIT Indore, I joined the world's second largest steel manufacturer in the world, ArcelorMittal in their joint venture with Nippon Steel, AM/NS India. 

As part of my deployment, I was posted as a technical data analyst in the compact strip production (CSP) division of the integrated steel plant in the region of Hazira, Gujarat, India. Here are some key highlights of my wonderful time back in the steel industry:

-	Performed data-driven time and motion-based study to reduce downtime of the production unit resulting in potential annual cost savings of 1.8 million dollar.
-	Cooperated with multiple departments and team leaders to provide sample data analysis and draw conclusions through intuitive visualisations.
-	Created a process monitoring dashboard on PowerBI for quick anomaly detection, which allowed for regular corrective and preventive actions to be taken on short notice and further reduced data cleaning operation duration from 1 hour to 20 minutes.
-	Compiled, maintained and visualised data containing critical sustainability indicators for studying the effect of the manufacturing plant on the environment.
-	Worked closely with R&D, Quality control and Automation department for resolving process and product defects through data driven studies.
-	Performed root cause analysis and suggested corrective actions for major product defects.
-	Conducted technical and software-based trainings for shop floor operators.
-	Implemented various statistical quality control techniques, such as control charts, to study and monitor the current process deviations before and after any significant process alteration through sample analysis.
-	Involved in investigation of customer or downstream complaints and suggesting corrective actions to prevent recurrence of similar complaints.

As a teaching assistant at the Indian Institute of Technology Indore, I was a part of the Advanced Mechanical Metallurgy laboratory, mostly working with various computational methods such as machine learning classification models and finite element models to detect defects in solid state welding processes such as Friction Stir Welding.

Some of my key highlights while in academia are as follows:

-	Conduct detailed experimentation and perform data analysis of the results from various metallurgical studies such as X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and universal testing machines.
-	Utilised machine learning models such as XGBoost, and LightGBM to train datasets which would allow for accurate detection of process parameters resulting in joint defects such as voids in welded mechanical joints.
-	Nominated as a delegate to showcase my research at the Annual Technical Meet hosted by The Indian Institute of Metals and was awarded with the best poster presentation for my research on creating a finite element model of aluminium and magnesium welded friction stir welded joints.
-	Compiled, maintained and visualised data containing critical sustainability indicators for studying the effect of the manufacturing plant on the environment.
-	Worked closely with R&D, Quality control and Automation department for resolving process and product defects through data driven studies.
-	Performed root cause analysis and suggested corrective actions for major product defects.
