It emphasises that men are disproportionately affected by drug-related mortality. Deaths from mental health and substance use disorders have significantly increased, especially in the U.S. and Canada, with a sharp spike following the COVID-19 pandemic. Among middle-aged individuals, those aged 15 to 49—especially working professionals in high-stress environments—are most affected by substance use disorders, suggesting work-related stress as a major contributing factor.\n\nTobacco remains the most lethal substance, causing over 7.2 million deaths annually—three times more than alcohol and significantly higher than illicit drugs. However, there’s a positive trend in declining cigarette consumption, with usage falling since 1974 and projections suggesting continued decline. On the other hand, the data also presents a concerning rise in synthetic drug use, with opioid overdose deaths surging by 58 times since 1990. The data underscores the urgent need for mental health support, particularly in high-stress industries, where professionals are at an elevated risk of substance dependence. Employers’ lack of adequate mental health support is also highlighted as a critical issue.\n",
