Substance use refers to the consumption of alcohol, drugs, or other psychoactive substances, which, in some cases, can develop into substance use disorders characterized by dependency and negative impacts on daily life. Mental health encompasses emotional, psychological, and social well-being, influencing how we think, feel, and act. Challenges in one area often affect the other; for instance, people with mental health disorders may turn to substances to self-medicate, while substance use can exacerbate or trigger mental health issues. Addressing both requires an integrated approach that considers their complex relationship to promote recovery and resilience.\n\nThis visual analysis highlights the alarming global trends in drug use, mental health, and substance-related deaths.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 9 √ó 7\n  Entity        Code   Year Total deaths from dr‚Ä¶¬π Total deaths from dr‚Ä¶¬≤ `2021`\n  <chr>         <chr> <dbl>                  <dbl>                  <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 Brazil        BRA    2021                   352.                  1002. 2.14e8\n2 Canada        CAN    2021                  1781.                  5552. 3.82e7\n3 China         CHN    2021                  2302.                  8943. 1.41e9\n4 Germany       DEU    2021                   359.                  1188. 8.32e7\n5 India         IND    2021                  2898.                  5552. 1.41e9\n6 North America <NA>   2021                 32910.                 82449. 3.70e8\n7 United Kingd‚Ä¶ GBR    2021                  1496.                  4135. 6.70e7\n8 United States USA    2021                 30935.                 76046. 3.32e8\n9 World         OWID‚Ä¶  2021                 48449.                126045. 7.89e9\n# ‚Ñπ abbreviated names: ¬π‚Äã`Total deaths from drug use disorders among females`,\n#   ¬≤‚Äã`Total deaths from drug use disorders among males`\n# ‚Ñπ 1 more variable: prop_male <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Share of deaths across genders\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 168 √ó 7\n   Entity       Code   Year Total deaths from dr‚Ä¶¬π Total deaths from dr‚Ä¶¬≤ `2021`\n   <chr>        <chr> <dbl>                  <dbl>                  <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 Ghana        GHA    2021                   5.78                   0.01 3.28e7\n 2 Lesotho      LSO    2021                  11.1                    6.69 2.28e6\n 3 Armenia      ARM    2021                   5.97                   3.93 2.79e6\n 4 Botswana     BWA    2021                   5.7                    4.67 2.59e6\n 5 Dominica     DMA    2021                   0.21                   0.18 7.24e4\n 6 Nicaragua    NIC    2021                   1.46                   1.32 6.85e6\n 7 Belize       BLZ    2021                   0.22                   0.2  4.00e5\n 8 Japan        JPN    2021                 140.                   132.   1.26e8\n 9 South Africa ZAF    2021                 614.                   590.   5.94e7\n10 Eswatini     SWZ    2021                   4.14                   4.39 1.19e6\n# ‚Ñπ 158 more rows\n# ‚Ñπ abbreviated names: ¬π‚Äã`Total deaths from drug use disorders among females`,\n#   ¬≤‚Äã`Total deaths from drug use disorders among males`\n# ‚Ñπ 1 more variable: ratio <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](matilda_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](matilda_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n200-word paragraph\n\nThe infographic titled ‚ÄúThe Dual Crisis: Mental Health and Substance Abuse in the Modern World‚Äù highlights the alarming global trends in drug use, mental health, and substance-related deaths. It emphasises that men are disproportionately affected by drug-related mortality. Deaths from mental health and substance use disorders have significantly increased, especially in the U.S. and Canada, with a sharp spike following the COVID-19 pandemic. Among middle-aged individuals, those aged 15 to 49‚Äîespecially working professionals in high-stress environments‚Äîare most affected by substance use disorders, suggesting work-related stress as a major contributing factor.\n\nTobacco remains the most lethal substance, causing over 7.2 million deaths annually‚Äîthree times more than alcohol and significantly higher than illicit drugs. However, there‚Äôs a positive trend in declining cigarette consumption, with usage falling since 1974 and projections suggesting continued decline. On the other hand, the data also presents a concerning rise in synthetic drug use, with opioid overdose deaths surging by 58 times since 1990. The data underscores the urgent need for mental health support, particularly in high-stress industries, where professionals are at an elevated risk of substance dependence. Employers‚Äô lack of adequate mental health support is also highlighted as a critical issue.\n",
