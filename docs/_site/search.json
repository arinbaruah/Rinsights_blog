    "text": "Source: Google\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\nThe current dataset contains the annual working hours per worker along with the population estimates of all the reporting countries dating from the start of the calendar year to 2021. The data source has been detailed on the Our World In Data website.\nThis is an important metric to track as the number of annual working hours is a strong indicator of the labor laws prevalent in the country along with the work-life balance for the various employees. High working hours invariably lead to higher health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression. With the advent of strict labor laws for the welfare of employees, the current study will dive deeper into how long are employees from various countries and continents working as years have passed on and whether the long hours are indicating strong growth in the economy.\n\n\n2 What are we looking to answer?\nThe current study aims to answer some of the following pertinent questions:\n\nWhich countries are reporting the highest annual working hours per employee? How have the annual working hours changed for these countries over time after stricter measures such as the implementation of labor codes in recent decades?\nHow are the working hours different for countries with high productive economies (GDP) ? Do the annual working hours vary with population and how do countries with comparable populations such as China and India fare?\nDoes working for longer hours directly mean that the productivity output of the economy is higher ?\n\n\n\n3 What is this dataset all about?\nThe current dataset which has been sourced from the Our World In Data website records the average annual working hours, state of economy (in terms of GDP), and population for a particular country over the years. In addition to these variables, the current dataset is merged with another dataset which contains important data on the \\({productivity}/{hour}\\) for the reporting countries. This measure in effect, tells us about the economic productivity of the country for every hour of work done by an employee (in $/hour).\nThe above-mentioned dataset can be obtained from the “Our World in Data” website through this link.\nTable 1 below shows the various variables present in our dataset.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Data description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\n\n\nEntity\n\n\nCode\n\n\nYear\n\n\nAnnual working hours per worker\n\n\nGDP per capita (output, multiple price benchmarks)\n\n\nPopulation (historical estimates)\n\n\nContinent\n\n\nProductivity: output per hour worked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 What can we infer from the data ?\nIn order to answer some of the pertinent research questions, we will need to create visualizations that can help us understand the data better and allow us to draw inferences. The intuitive visualizations are created using the ggplot2 library which is based on the grammar of graphics. The documentation for the ggplot2 library can be referred to in greater detail through this link.\nFigure 1 is a scatter plot between the annual working hours and the GDP per capita of some of the nations of concern in the current study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Relation between annual working hours and GDP per capita\n\n\n\n\n\nThe annotations in Figure 1 provides us the relevant information, thereby allowing us to obtain important insights while analysing the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation overload\n\n\n\nHowever, when creating a visualisation for a presentation, we are interested to only show the interesting bits to the audience. This not only allows us to concentrate our analysis on the salient data points, but also reduces cognitive load on the part of the audience, as a result of which, they’re able to gauge the information easily, and are constantly following the presenter.\nLet us try to tweak our plot to make it more engaging for an audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Relation between annual working hours and GDP per capita with high contrast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nThe high contrast of the data points, namely India, China and Singapore in Figure 2 which are the major outliers and need to be investigated further can be clearly distinguished from the other data points. This allows for the audience to quickly notice these points and follow the presenter’s explanations better.\nAnother change was the title of the plot to make it more interactive for the audience. While this works better in a presentation mode, plots which are a part of a report would benefit with a general title as observed in Figure 1.\n\n\nFigure 2 titled “Annual working hour vs GDP per capita” represents a scatter plot with the X-axis containing the variable of GDP Per capita (in $) and the Y-axis containing the variable of Annual working hours per worker. The plot has been created for a list of countries with well-established economies along with some of the manufacturing-based economies like China and India. Below are some of the key points observed that can provide answers to the research questions posed in section 3 :\n\nThe scatterplot has been divided into 4 quadrants to facilitate the clustering of the various economies and the quadrants have been explained through the plot annotation. We can observe that the emerging developing nations with comparable populations such as India and China are reporting considerably higher annual working hours than the other major developed economies. This could be a result of the lack of strict labor codes prevalent in these countries leading to highly overworked employees.\nSingapore is a developed economy with a very low population. Yet, the annual working hours are reported to be higher than all the developed nations as well as the developing economies of India and China. This could be attributed to the hectic working culture prevalent in the corporates of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Rise of productivity over time (in terms of GDP)\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to our previous attempts, while Figure 3 provides us with an illustration of rising productivity over time, the plot is too cluttered and is difficult to follow.\nLet us simplify this plot further using the same techniques as before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Rise of productivity over time (in terms of GDP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nFigure 4 titled “Productivity over the years” represents a line chart containing a temporal analysis of the productivity of each of the selected nations from Figure 2. Productivity is defined as the contribution to the GDP (in $) for each hour worked by an employee. The following can be inferred from the plot :\n\nThe temporal analysis for productivity (contribution to GDP in $) against the years indicates that there is a steady increase in the contribution towards GDP (in $) for all the countries under consideration. In essence, the temporal trend suggests that over the many decades of study, an hour of work done by an employee yields a higher contribution towards the nation’s economy for every country.\nIn figure Figure 2, it was established that Singapore, China, and India were the countries with the highest annual working hours. While intuitively, it may be hypothesized that higher working hours would mean greater productivity, however as per figure Figure 4 , it can be observed that the productivity of the economy for these three countries were found to be lower than that of the other economies. Therefore, longer working hours per employee does not necessarily contribute to higher productivity of the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Conclusion\nThe above study explored the various relations between the annual working hours of each country’s economy, its GDP per capita and the contribution towards the productivity of its economy. In order to create a condensed analysis of the major economies, a specific list of countries was curated and its results were visualised through Figure 2 and Figure 4 for inference. The study was observed to draw the following inferences delineated as follows :\n\nEmerging economies based on GDP per capita with similar populations such as China and India which are heavily dependent on their manufacturing industries were observed to have considerably higher annual working hours when compared to developed economies.This could be a result of the leaner labor codes enforced in these countries when compared to the developed economies.\nWhile Singapore is a country with high GDP per capita and low population, it was observed to report higher annual working hours compared to China and India along with all other developed economies under consideration. This could be a result of the work culture in corporations based out of Singapore.\nA steady rise in the productivity of each nation under consideration was observed which essentially meant that an employee’s hourly output has been increasing over time.\nWhile Singapore, China, and India reported the highest annual working hours, it’s productivity was observed to be lower than all other developed economies in the current study. This finding demonstrated that higher annual working hours do not necessarily lead to higher productivity in the economy.\n\n\n\n6 References\n\nggplot2: H.

    "text": "1 Description\nThe goal of any visualisation is to be able to effectively convey insights and reduce cognitive load on the part of the audience to understand these insights.\nIn this challenge by “Storytelling with data”, we are primarily required to eliminate the clutter in the plot as illustrated by Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Automation in various lines of payments\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Changes proposed to reduce the clutter\n\nThe first issue I was able to observe in the graph is that there is too much information in the bar graph and we need to focus on only the key details which can allow us to get better insights without being overwhelmed by all the available data.\nAdditionally, the percentage values in the plot were overly accurate (upto 1 decimal point) which is not a particular concern when trying to obtain insights from these graphs. Hence, we can round up or down the percentage values, thereby making it easier to compare the two graphs.\nInstead of visualising the data in bars, a better option would be to visualise the data as a line plot as it is easier to observe the trends of automation in the temporal space.\nIn this plot, it was particularly interesting to observe the rise of automation for home equity line of credits as compared to the other payment methods. Hence, the colour and the text labels for this datapoint was emphasised through a darker colour shade.\nAn appropriate title was used to emphasise the most interesting aspect of the current data as illustrated by Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Line plot to visualise the change in payment automation across various payment methods"

    "text": "5.1 Are we observing a rise in the popularity of research ?\nWhile the universities and research labs across the United States have historically produced some of the best researchers in the world, it is important to study the growth of these researchers. One of the ways to do so would be through analysing the number of graduating PhDs in the various fields of research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of graduating PhDs in the US\n\n\n\n\n\nAs illustrated through Figure 1, we can observe a trend of rising PhD graduates in the United States. Between the years of 2008 to 2017, apart from the year of 2010, there has been a constant rise in the number of PhD students graduating across the various universities and research labs in the country. Since 2008 to 2017, we can observe a 12.6 % rise in the total number of graduating PhD students as per the statistics released by The National Science Foundation (NSF). The rise in these numbers can be attributed to the funding received in various fields of research, leading to higher recruitment and consequently, higher number of PhD graduates. This additionally makes the United States a very attractive study destination for the rest of the world. As a result, we can definitely observe a rise in the popularity of the research field in The United States of America."

    "text": "5.2 Which fields of research are these PhDs graduating in ?\nIn this section, we shall investigate the popular areas of research. While there has been an overall rise in the number of graduating PhDs as explained in Section 5.1, however, not all broad fields of research may observe the same growth in popularity. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of the total number of PhD graduates in each of the broad fields of research. We can observe that the field of Life Sciences attracts the highest number of PhDs while the least number of PhD graduates can be observed in the STEM field of Engineering.\nThe results corroborate with the findings of Meirmans et al. (2019) who have identified the field of biological life sciences to be the one with the highest fundings worldwide as these researches are directly related to various answering some of the toughest challenges to mankind such as curing cancer, eradication of polio, epidemic research as such COVID-19, and many such critical studies.\nOn the other hand, the field of engineering is observed to attract the least number of researchers. A part of the reason maybe due to the vast number of opportunities in the industry or the corporate which tends to attract more number of engineering graduates rather than the field of research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: PhD graduates in each broad field"

As we can observe, there is indeed an uneven distribution of graduates in the various major fields of Life Sciences. We can observe that the number of graduates in the domain of biological and biomedical sciences is more than double the number of students in the second most popular field which is the field of Physics and astronomy.\n\nThis clearly suggests that the requirement for researchers and the funding available in the major field of biological and biomedical sciences is considerable higher than any other major field of Life Sciences."

As we can observe, the number of researchers in the field of Computer Engineering is much higher than the next popular field of Environmental Engineering.\n\nThis can be attributed to the recent advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Science, and many more state of the art technologies"

The game was further introduced in early day Persia from India in around 600 AD. The game was well documented through various manuscripts as it was a marvellous game especially for those who wanted to become military commanders. It was said that chess helped build a multi approach warfare ideas. Hence, the game became extremely relevant during the times when there was no status quo amongst kingdoms and wars were frequent. At around 1850, the first Chess tournament was held in US and ever since then, it has become a sport that has been featuring in various international sports competitions like the Olympics, Commonwealth games, etc.\nIn this particular notebook, we will try to explore the data of women chess players and understand some key insights.\n\n\n\nSource: The Athletic"

    "text": "As we all know, with the advent of mobile internet access for all, the world has moved from MP3 downloaded songs to streaming services. A streaming service maybe paid/unpaid subscription that lets you stream songs with a stable internet connection on your device. A paid subscription also lets you download songs on to your device to be listened to anytime even with your internet connection.\nCurrently, Spotify and Apple Music are the top two streaming services available. Apple Music is primarily used by iOS/MacOS users while Spotify is used by any platform using internet services. Currently, as of 2020, Spotify has about 130 million subscribers compared to Apple Music with 75 million subscribers.\nHence, we can say Spotify is the leading music service by quite a distance. These music streams use curated playlists through various ML recommendation systems that keep feeding you with interesting songs and hence, keeping you interested in their services constantly.\nThrough this kernel, we would like to analyse the top 50 songs published by Spotify in 2019. We will check the various genres, popularity and some other features that made the songs to famous amongst the users."

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe Taipan class of reptiles are indigenous to the land mass of Australia as well as Papua New Guinea, and are considered to be one of the deadliest snakes on the planet. The Taipan, scientifically known as the Oxyuranus genus, comprises several species, with the Coastal Taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) and the Inland Taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus) being the most renowned. These reptiles are highly venomous and belong to the elapid family, which includes other infamous snakes like the king cobra and the black mamba. According to Markwell and Cushing (2016), what sets the taipan apart, however, is its reputation as having the most toxic venom of any snake in the world !\nIn our current analysis, we will be focusing on the occurrences of a specific subspecies of the Coastal Taipan across the various states of Australia. The subgroup of the Coastal Taipans which has been scientifically named as Oxyuranus Scutellatus Scutellatus, is commonly found in the northern regions of Australia and is renowned for its agility and speed. It primarily feeds on small mammals, birds, and occasionally reptiles, using its potent venom to immobilize its prey swiftly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The coastal taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus)\n\n\n\nCharacterized by its slender body, shiny scales, and formidable fangs, the Taipan is a formidable predator. Despite its fearsome reputation, these snakes are generally reclusive and rarely encountered by humans. They prefer to inhabit coastal regions, woodlands, and savannas, blending seamlessly into their natural surroundings as can be observed in Figure 1.\nWhile the Coastal Taipans are not classified as endangered species, however, with rapid human activities such as urbanisation and encroachment of wildlife area for agricultural purposes, the habitat of these reptiles have been increasingly affected as a result of which, steps have been taken by wild life conservationists to preserve their natural habitats to the best extent possible.\n\n1.1 Data source:\n\nThe data was sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) using the galah R package.\nThe weather station data to study impact of weather conditions on sightings was sourced from National Climatic Data Centre (NCDC) using rnoaa package in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey assumptions\n\n\n\nBased on the literature surveys for the Coastal Taipan, here are our assumptions while moving forward with our analysis:\n\nBased on the information from the Australia Museum, the Coastal Taipans are active throughout the year but are observed to be most commonly encountered during late winter to spring (August to December of a calendar year).\nAs can be inferred from its colloquial name, the Coastal Taipans are often observed in the coastal regions of Australia.\nBased on a study by Billabong Sanctuary, the Coastal Taipans are not endangered and have probably increased in numbers due to the growth in the number of rats (who are the primary prey) in areas close to the human settlements.\nCoastal Taipans depend primarily on their venom as their defensive mechanism and consider human interactions as an act of aggression. Consequently, the number of sightings across Australia can be considered to be limited to certain regions and in small numbers.\nThe Coastal Taipans, like any other snakes are territorial in nature and do not migrate from their region over the years.\n\n\n\nAlthough we will attempt to accurately analyse the data by obtaining it from reliable repositories, however, it is important to consider the limitations of the dataset while making critical conclusions based on the data in hand. Some of the limitations of the current dataset are delineated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of the data\n\n\n\n\nSince the data which has been obtained from the Atlast of Living Australia falls under the category of observational data, there could be instances of missing values. These instances will need to be filtered out while analysing the data from the repository.\nSince the data is obtained from various sources, there could be inconsistencies in reporting the data.\nWhile the data collection was done in an extensive and granular manner, there could be a lack of precision of the observations made for the exact latitude and longitude.\nThe dataset obtained from the Atlas of Living Australia only reports for all the Coastal Taipans that have been sighted and recorded. Hence, it does not report the entire population of these reptiles across the various regions of Australia. This may lead to inaccurate conclusions post analysis of the limited data in hand.\nThe dataset here consist of observational data and in particular, occurrences data. Some of the limitations that are prevalent in such datasets are as follows :\n\nThe data here is obtained from various sources. As a result, there may be non-uniformity in the data provided. Each reporting authority may have their own interpretations of the data they may have provided.\nThe current dataset obtained is a subset of an observational data. These types of data are often plagued with lack of randomisation during the selection of data. This may lead to biases in the dataset such as selection and systematic bias.\nThe data maybe misclassified or filled in non-uniform units by the various sources, leading to lack of accuracy of the overall dataset."

For latitude (-90 to 90) and for longitude (-180 to 180). This would help detect any unusual or erroneous data points.\nConsistency Checks: Make sure there aren’t any discrepancies in the way data is represented across rows.\nMissing Value Analysis: Any missing values should be analyzed to understand the reason behind them.\nDate Consistency: Ensure that the event dates fall within expected ranges and are formatted correctly.\n\n\n\n3.3 Data Quality Check\n\nvis_miss(taipan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Representation of missing values in the dataset\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vis_miss() function from the “visdat” package provides a visual representation of missing data in the dataset.\nThe plot illustrated in Figure 2 indicates that about half of the total dataset has missing values. These missing values can be observed majorly in the variables of eventRemarks,eventTime and eventID. In order to improve the quality of the overall data, we will consider either transforming these variables or removing them as a part of feature selection in the following sections.\n\nlat_summary &lt;- taipan$decimalLatitude %&gt;% fivenum()\nlong_summary &lt;- taipan$decimalLongitude %&gt;% fivenum()\n\nsummary_table &lt;- tibble(\n  Statistic = c(\"Minimum\", \"1st Quartile\", \"Median\", \"3rd Quartile\", \"Maximum\"),\n  Latitude = lat_summary,\n  Longitude = long_summary\n) \n\nkable(summary_table, format = \"html\", table.attr = \"class='table'\") %&gt;% \n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), position = \"center\") %&gt;%\n  column_spec(1, border_right = TRUE) %&gt;%  # Add a line between columns\n  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = \"white\", background = \"lightblue\")\n\n\n\nTable 1: Representation of five number summary of values in the dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistic\nLatitude\nLongitude\n\n\n\n\nMinimum\n-28.16667\n131.1667\n\n\n1st Quartile\n-25.74854\n145.2500\n\n\nMedian\n-17.93333\n145.9833\n\n\n3rd Quartile\n-15.46667\n152.2000\n\n\nMaximum\n-10.88333\n154.4333\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fivenum() function in R provides a summary of five-number statistics: the minimum, lower-hinge (25th percentile or first quartile), median (50th percentile), upper-hinge (75th percentile or third quartile), and the maximum.\nBy analyzing these statistics in Table 1, we can get an overview of the distribution of latitudes and longitudes in the dataset. The five number summary of the latitude and longitude values further allows us to validate the values with each latitude and longitude observation being within the maximum and minimum possible limits.\n\n\n3.4 Data transformation and feature selection\nAs we are primarily interested in analysing the wild sightings of the Coastal Taipans across Australia, hence, we will filter out the data obtained from museums and animal sanctuaries. This information has been provided in the event ID column which will be used to filter the required data as shown in the code chunk below. It has been additionally assumed that the occurrences with no mention of the term “museum” have been considered as wild sightings in the context of the current study.\n\ntaipan &lt;- taipan %&gt;% mutate(occurrence = if_else(str_detect(taipan$eventID,\"museum\"),\"Museum\",\"Wild\"))\ntaipan$occurrence &lt;- replace_na(taipan$occurrence,\"Wild\")\n\ntaipan_occurrs &lt;- taipan %&gt;% group_by(occurrence) %&gt;% summarise(Count =  n())  \n\nggplot(taipan_occurrs, aes(x = occurrence,y = Count)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = occurrence)) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings\",\n       x = \"Occurrence Type\",\n       y = \"Number of sightings\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + geom_label(aes(label =Count))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Figure 3 displays the distribution of Taipan sightings categorized into two types: Museum and Wild. It’s evident from the figure that a portion of the data is sourced from museums, which means these observations don’t represent the natural behavior or occurrence of Taipans in their wild habitats.\nFor a comprehensive study of the natural behavior or occurrence patterns of Taipans, it’s pertinent to focus solely on the “Wild” type data.\n\n # Selecting only wild occurrences of Coastal Taipans\ntaipan_wild &lt;- taipan %&gt;% filter(occurrence ==\"Wild\")\n\nWe have observed a total of 240 occurrences across Australia. However, this number has been obtained from the raw data which will need to be cleaned further.\n\nBased on the initial data analysis, we will need to perform the following data cleaning operations:\n\nFilter the data with valid sighting date for detailed temporal analysis.\nFilter the data with valid values of longitude and latitude for detailed spatial analysis.\n\n\n\ntaipan_wild &lt;- taipan_wild %&gt;% \n  rename(Longitude = decimalLongitude,\n         Latitude = decimalLatitude) %&gt;%\n  mutate(eventDate = as.Date(eventDate)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(eventDate)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Longitude)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Latitude)) %&gt;% select(-c(\"samplingEffort\",\"samplingProtocol\",\"taxonConceptID\",\"recordID\",\"dataResourceName\"))\nsave(taipan_wild, file=here::here(\"data/taipan.rda\"))\n\n\n‼️💡 Upon performing the required data cleaning operation, we have a total of 100 wild sightings of Coastal Taipans across Australia. 💡‼️\n\n\n3.4.1 Combining data of sightings with weather data ⛈️\nIn order to explore the prevailing weather conditions during the sighting, we will need to merge the datasets from two different sources. Here, we will utilise the weather data reported from the various weather stations in Australia by utilising the RNOAA package which is maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The following code chunk allows us to obtain the weather conditions, namely precipitation (PRCP), maximum temperature (TMAX) and minimum temperature (TMIN). In order to utilise data from active weather stations, we have filtered those data whose last reported conditions were relayed after the year of 2020.\n\naus_stations &lt;- ghcnd_stations() |&gt;\n  filter(str_starts(id, \"ASN\")) |&gt;\n  filter(last_year &gt;= 2020) |&gt;\n  mutate(wmo_id = as.numeric(wmo_id),\n         name = str_to_lower(name)) |&gt;\n  select(-state, -gsn_flag) |&gt;\n  filter(element %in% c(\"PRCP\", \"TMAX\", \"TMIN\")) |&gt;\n  nest(element: last_year) |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  filter(nrow(data) == 3) |&gt;\n  select(-data) \n\nOnce we have obtained the weather data, we need to merge the sighting data with the weather conditions. For this purpose, we can utilise the geographical data (latitude and longitude) to merge the closest weather station data with the location of the Coastal Taipan sighting.\n\n‼️ Since it is difficult to exactly match the latitude and longitude of the sighting to the weather station, hence, we will convert the geographical data into spatial objects and then utilise the nearest feature function to merge the weather conditions of the location of the sighting to the closest weather reporting station. This has been done in the following code chunk. ‼️\n\n\n# Convert the datasets into spatial objects\ntaipan_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(taipan_wild, coords = c(\"Longitude\", \"Latitude\"), crs = 4326)\naus_stations_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(aus_stations, coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\n# Perform the nearest neighbor join\nnearest_stations &lt;- st_nearest_feature(taipan_sf, aus_stations_sf)\n\n# Combine the datasets\ncombined_data &lt;- cbind(taipan_wild, aus_stations[nearest_stations, ])\n\ncombined_data &lt;- as.data.frame(combined_data)\nunique_id &lt;- unique(combined_data$id)\n\nOnce we have successfully mapped the sighting data with each of the weather stations, let us try to observe the most frequent sightings with respect to its closest weather station.\n\ncombined_count &lt;- combined_data %&gt;% group_by(name) %&gt;% summarise(Count = n())\ntop_2 &lt;- c(\"cooktown airport\",\"townsville aero\")\n\nggplot(combined_count,aes(x = reorder(name,Count),y = Count)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + theme_classic() + ggtitle(\"Number of Coastal Taipan sightings \\n for each weather station\")  + geom_label(data = ~filter(.x, name %in% top_2),aes(label = Count),vjust=0.8) +  labs(x = \"Weather station name\",y = \"Number of Coastal Taipan sightings\",caption = \"Source: National Climatic Data Center and Atlas of Living Australia\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Number of sightings for each weather station\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 illustrates the number of Coastal Taipan sightings for each of the weather stations in Australia. Based on the illustration, we will be able to narrow down our search for the location with frequent sightings of the reptile and can drill down our analysis to obtain weather information.\nHere, we observe that the weather stations Cooktown Airport and Townsville Aero have significantly higher number of sightings when compared to the rest of the data. Let us pull the weather information for these weather stations through the below code chunk.\n\nnarrogin &lt;- aus_stations |&gt;\n  filter(name %in% top_2) |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(ts = list(meteo_pull_monitors(\n    monitors = id, var = c(\"PRCP\", \"TMAX\", \"TMIN\"),\n    date_min = \"1950-01-01\",\n    date_max = \"2023-09-13\") |&gt;\n      select(-id))) |&gt;\n  rename(Latitude = latitude, Longitude = longitude, elev = elevation) |&gt; select(id, Longitude, Latitude, elev, name, wmo_id, ts) %&gt;%\n  unnest(ts) |&gt;\n  mutate(tmax = tmax/10, tmin = tmin/ 10)\n\nIn the next part, we will create a new variable called sighting with values of either 0 or 1 to mark the sighting of the Coastal Taipan. This variable is important because,\n\nthe weather data obtained is for all the possible dates which match our time period filter. This does not necessarily mean that a Coastal Taipan was observed on that particular day. Hence, upon merging the weather and the sighting dataset, it is important to distinguish the days (obtained by eventDate) which mark the sighting of a Coastal Taipan. We will be primarily interested to analyse the prevailing weather conditions on these particular days for the choice of our weather stations.\n\n\nsubset_combined_data &lt;- combined_data %&gt;% filter(name %in% top_2)\ntaipan_weather &lt;- right_join(subset_combined_data,narrogin,by = c(\"id\",\"eventDate\"=\"date\"))\ntaipan_weather &lt;- taipan_weather %&gt;% mutate(sighting = if_else(!is.na(occurrenceStatus) ,1,0))\nsave(taipan_weather, file=here::here(\"data/taipan_weather_sighting.rda\"))"

We can observe that the sightings are higher between the months of July to December when compared to the rest of the year. This can be a result of the prevailing monsoon conditions in Australia which closely corroborates with our assumption stated in Section 1.\nSome of the reasons why the Coastal Taipans are observed to be more active are as follows:\n\nBreeding season: The Coastal Taipans are highly active during the breeding season which closely conincides with the monsoon season in Australia.\nIncreased prey availability: The monsoon season in northern Australia typically brings heavy rainfall, which can lead to flooding in some areas. This flooding forces small mammals, reptiles, and other prey animals out of their burrows and hiding places, making them more accessible to Coastal Taipans. The increased prey availability during the monsoon can lead to an uptick in snake activity as they take advantage of the abundance of food.\nTemperature and humidity: Reptiles are ectothermic in nature, meaning their body temperature is highly influenced by the environmental temperature. Monsoon season generally brings about warm and humid conditions. These conditions additionally improve the metabolism and mobility in reptiles which allows for higher activity and increased number of Coastal Taipan sightings.\nMigratory behaviour: Due to increased mobility in the reptiles during the monsoon season, some Coastal Taipans exhibit migrate behaviour for better conditions and availability of prey. Migrations can often lead to human interactions and hence, their consequent sightings.\n\n💡\n\n\n\n4.2 Where are the Coastal Taipans most commonly observed in Australia?\n\n# Assuming your dataset is named `sightings` and has columns `latitude` and `longitude`\nleaflet(data = taipan) %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;%\n  addCircles(lng = ~decimalLongitude, lat = ~decimalLatitude, popup = paste(\"Scientific name:\",taipan$scientificName, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                              \"Latitude:\",taipan$decimalLatitude,\"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                              \"Longitude:\",taipan$decimalLongitude,\"&lt;br&gt;\"), radius = 50, color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Regions of Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia\n\n\n\n\n\nsourceSightings &lt;- taipan %&gt;% \n                   group_by(dataResourceName) %&gt;% \n                   summarise(count = n())\ncolnames(sourceSightings) &lt;- c(\"Data Source\", \"Number of Sightings\")\n\nkable(sourceSightings, format = \"html\", table.attr = \"class='table'\") %&gt;% \n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), position = \"center\") %&gt;%\n  column_spec(1, border_right = TRUE) %&gt;%  # Add a line between columns\n  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = \"white\", background = \"lightblue\")\n\n\n\nTable 2: Number of sightings reported by each data source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source\nNumber of Sightings\n\n\n\n\nALA species sightings and OzAtlas\n1\n\n\nAustralian Museum provider for OZCAM\n2\n\n\nQueensland Museum provider for OZCAM\n236\n\n\niNaturalist Australia\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 illustrates that, in alignment with its name, most Coastal Taipan sightings occur in coastal regions. Additionally, considering that a significant portion of the data comes from the “Queensland Museum provider for OZCAM” as observed by Table 2, it can be determined that a majority of these sightings are concentrated in the coastal areas of Queensland. It is also particularly interesting to note that one sighting observed in the Northern Territory indicating a possibility of migration and future possibilities of higher sightings in this region.\n\n💡💡 The Coastal Taipan’s preference for coastal regions in Australia can be attributed to the habitat, climate, and prey availability in these areas. Coastal regions provide a favorable environment with adequate warmth, humidity, and shelter. These conditions are conducive for the Taipan’s survival and reproduction. Additionally, coastal areas offer a rich biodiversity, ensuring ample prey for the snake. The vegetation in these regions, like grasslands and woodlands, offers suitable hiding spots for the snake and its prey, leading to a higher likelihood of the Taipan being found in these areas.\n\n\n\n4.3 Has there been a rise in the number of Coastal Taipans in Australia over the years?\n\npopulation_count &lt;- taipan_wild %&gt;% \n  mutate(year = year(eventDate)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  filter(year != \"1915\") %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\ntrend &lt;- ggplot(population_count, aes(x = year, y = count)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = \"Yearly Count\"), linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(color = \"Trend Line\"), method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, size = 1.5,linetype = 'dashed') +\n  labs(title = \"Trend of Coastal Taipan Sightings Over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Sightings\",\n       color = \"Legend\") +\n  theme_classic()\nggplotly(trend)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Trend of Coastal Taipan Sightings Over the years of 1915-2020\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 demonstrates a noticeable increase in sightings over the years, potentially suggesting a growth in the Coastal Taipan population, indicating they might not be “endangered”. However, there are caveats to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\n\nSightings vs. Population: The number of sightings does not necessarily equate to the actual population. An increase in sightings could be due to increased human activity in the taipan’s habitat or better reporting mechanisms.\nIncomplete Data: The dataset might not cover all sightings, especially as it has limited data sources or regions.\nExternal Factors: Factors like urban development, habitat destruction, or climate change can influence the habitats and distribution of species, which can subsequently influence sighting reports.\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Are the Coastal Taipans limited to certain regions of Australia ?\nIn Section 4.2, we were able to observe that the Coastal Taipans are observed to be sighted close to the coasts. In this section, we will be focused on assessing whether the sighting locations of the Coastal Taipans suggest that these reptiles are limited to certain regions of Australia only. The same will be assessed through the generation of a null plot and testing a hypothesis. The hypothesis and the null generating mechanism are as follows:\n\n\\(H_o\\) : Coastal Taipans are not limited to a single region and can be sighted all over Australia.\n\\(H_1\\) : Coastal Taipans are limited to certain regions of Australia, particularly in humid and warm conditions.\nNull generating mechanism: Usage of the “null_permute” function to permute the latitude values of the Coastal Taipan sightings.\n\n\nset.seed(1232536)\naustralia_map &lt;- map_data(\"world\", region = \"Australia\")\n\n\n# Overlay the soccer pitch as a custom annotation on the scatter plot\nmap_null_plot &lt;- ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = australia_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n   geom_point(data = lineup(null_permute(\"Latitude\"),taipan_wild, n = 20),\n                      aes(x = Longitude,y = Latitude),color = \"red\",alpha = 0.4) + facet_wrap(~.sample) + theme_classic() + theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank())\nmap_null_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Null lineup plot for occurrences of Coastal Taipan sightings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nUpon analysing the plot null lineup plots in Figure 8, we observed that of the 8 test cases, 7 people were able to recognise the plot 4 as the most unique plot due to the scatter points (sighting locations) being limited to only the coastal regions of Australia. The P-value for the following result is 5.9765626^{-9} which suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected and we can conclude that there is significant evidence in the data to suggest that Coastal Taipans are majorly limited to the North-Eastern coast of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Has the geographical distribution of Coastal Taipans remained consistent over the years?\nSnakes are typically reclusive and territorial. Given this characteristic, it’s intriguing to consider whether coastal taipans exhibit similar behavior. Specifically, it’s of interest to determine if coastal taipans remain in their established habitats due to their inherent nature or external factors or if there are distinct regions they consistently inhabit. This investigation will be facilitated by generating a null plot and conducting hypothesis testing. The pertinent hypotheses and the mechanism for generating the null distribution are outlined as follows:\n\n\\(H_o\\): The geographical distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings has remained consistent over the years, with no significant difference in distribution between the periods pre-2000s and post-2000s.\n\\(H_1\\): The geographical distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings has changed between the periods pre-2000s and post-2000s.\nNull generating mechanism: Usage of the “null_permute” function to permute the eventCategory (Pre or Post 2000s categorisation) values of the Coastal Taipan sightings.\n\n\ntaipan_wild &lt;- taipan_wild %&gt;%\n  mutate(eventCategory = ifelse(year(eventDate) &lt; 2000, \"pre-2000s\", \"post-2000s\"))\n\nset.seed(201349)\n\nggplot(lineup(null_permute('eventCategory'), taipan_wild), aes(x = Longitude, y= Latitude, color = eventCategory), n=20) +\n  borders(\"world\", regions = \"Australia\", fill = \"white\", colour = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~ .sample, nrow = 2) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Null Distribution of Taipan Sightings by Location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nUpon analysing the plot null lineup plots in Figure 9, we observed that of the 8 test cases, only 2 people were able to recognise the plot 19 as the most unique plot due to the scatter points being limited to only the coastal regions of Australia. The P-value for the following result is 0.0572447 which suggests that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected based on 95% confidence and we can conclude that there is significant evidence in the data to suggest that Coastal Taipans are consistently sighted in the same regions in Australia over the years.\n\n\n\n\n4.6 How are the weather conditions like in the areas with Coastal Taipan sightings ?\nIn this section, we will be interested to find any insights with respect to the weather in the locations with high Coastal Taipan sightings.\n\n4.6.1 Does rain play a role in the sightings of the Coastal Taipans ? ⛈️\n\ntaipan_rain &lt;- taipan_weather %&gt;% filter(sighting == 1) %&gt;% mutate(rain = if_else(!is.na(prcp) & prcp&gt; 0,\"Rain recorded\",\"No rain recorded\"))\n\ntaipan_rain_group &lt;-\n  taipan_rain %&gt;% group_by(rain) %&gt;% summarise(Total = n())\nrain_plot &lt;-\n  ggplot(data = taipan_rain_group, aes(\n    x = as.factor(rain),\n    y = Total,\n    fill = factor(rain)\n  )) + geom_col(color='black') + geom_label(aes(label = Total)) + theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rain indication for the day of sighting\",y = \"Total number of sightings\")\nrain_plot + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Number of Coastal Taipan sightings on days of observed precipitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nBased on our analysis of Figure 10, we can observe that of the 27 observations, 23 of the sightings took place on days with no recorded precipitation while only 4 sightings took place on days with recorded precipitation. This suggests that the precipitation may not have a strong association with the Coastal Taipan sightings. However, it must also be kept in mind that the current sample of the dataset is too small to generate any strong conclusions from the data and we may require further data to support our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n4.6.2 How are the temperatures during the days of sightings ? ☀️\nLet us now explore the minimum and maximum temperatures on the given day of Coastal Taipan sightings and analyse any further insights.\n\ntaipan_weather1 &lt;- taipan_weather %&gt;% filter(sighting == 1) \ntaipan_weather1 &lt;- taipan_weather1 %&gt;% mutate(observation = 1:nrow(taipan_weather1))\ntaipan_weather1$observation &lt;- factor(taipan_weather1$observation)\npl_temp &lt;- ggplot(taipan_weather1, aes(y = observation)) +\n  geom_dumbbell(aes(x = tmin, xend = tmax),\n                color = \"darkgray\",\n                size = 1, dot_guide = FALSE, \n                size_x = 3,  size_xend = 3,\n                colour_xend = \"#F69541\", colour_x = \"#699DC6\") +\n    geom_text(aes(x = tmin, label = tmin), hjust = 1.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = tmax, label = tmax), hjust = -0.2) +\n  xlim(0,40) + labs(x = \"Minimum and maximum temperatures observed (degree Celsius)\",\n                                      y = \"Coastal Taipan sighting unique observation\")  + theme_classic()\n   \npl_temp + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(taipan_weather1$tmax,na.rm = TRUE),alpha = 0.5,linetype =2,color = 'red') +  \n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(taipan_weather1$tmin,na.rm = TRUE),alpha = 0.5,linetype =2,color = 'blue') +\n    scale_linetype_manual(values = \"Mean Temperature\", name = \"Line Type\") +\n    annotate(\n    \"text\",\n    x = 35,\n    y = 8,\n    colour = \"red\",\n    label = paste0(\"Average maximum temperature:\",round(mean(taipan_weather1$tmax,na.rm = TRUE),1)),\n    size = unit(3, \"pt\") \n  ) +\n      annotate(\n    \"text\",\n    x = 5,\n    y = 14,\n    colour = \"blue\",\n    label = paste0(\"Average minimum temperature:\",round(mean(taipan_weather1$tmin,na.rm = TRUE),1)),\n    size = unit(3, \"pt\")\n      )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Temperature range on the days of Coastal Taipan sightings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nUpon analysing the maximum and minimum temperatures on the days of Coastal Taipan sightings as illustrated by Figure 11, we can observe that the majority of the sightings were recorded on days with relatively higher maximum and minimum temperatures. This suggests that the mobility of the reptiles are higher during warmer conditions leading to higher probability of their sightings. Higher temperatures also induce lower mobility among the prey of the Taipans to protect themselves from the heat, as a result of which, the reptiles are also on the move to hunt.\nThe average maximum and minimum temperatures visualised by the two vertical lines in the plot are 28.1 and 19 degree celsius respectively, suggesting warm conditions."

    "text": "5 Summary\nBased on our detailed analysis of the Coastal Taipan sightings, following are our key takeaways:\n\n💡💡\n\n\nThe spatial analysis suggests that the Coastal Taipans are territorial in nature, thereby inhabiting the coastal regions of Queensland with possibility of migration towards Northern Territory in the future.\nBased on the frequency of sightings, the Coastal Taipans are not endagered. However, they are extremely reclusive and avoid human contact. Hence, their occurrences and sightings are rare as they are mostly confined to their habitats.\nWhile migration of the Coastal Taipans maybe a possibility in the future, based on the data, there is not enough strong evidence to suggest that there has been a significant change in the Coastal Taipan’s habitat.\nContrary to popular belief, the data does not exhibit a strong evidence to suggest that the sightings of Coastal Taipans are higher on days of recorded precipitation. However, the Coastal Taipans do exhibit higher mobility during the monsoon period resulting in higher sightings.\nCoastal Taipans appear to be especially active on warm days, possibly due to their increased mobility and metabolism, consequently resulting in higher sightings on these days.\n\n💡💡"

We can also observe that none of the features are highly correlated to one another. This indicates that there is no multicollinearity in the choice of our features."

It could also indicate that the banking services or customer services in Germany might be lacking as compared to the other countries which have resulted in the higher churn percentage. Diving deeper into the banking practices of Germany would provide a better understanding as to the reason for the high attrition of customers."

This could also be measure taken by the bank to reduce the burden of keeping the services activated for accounts which have shown little to no activity for an extended period of duraiton."

Contrary to belief, the percentage of churns are actually higher for accounts with positive balance as compared to zero balance accounts.\nThis could be due to the fact that account holders with zero balances are generally inactive and may not proactively close their accounts but rather, is done so by the bank to reduce the maintenance cost of keeping zero balance accounts active. However, account holders with positive balance may proactively choose to close their accounts due to various reasons as stated in Section 1 which may lead to the higher percentage of churned accounts."

At the same time, extreme levels of engineering is done to simulate the similar space conditions back on earth and test the launch vehicles for any possible failures. All these space missions require years of hard work, research and tests for success.\nIt provides immense national pride when launches are successful. However, it is also incredibly disheartening when the missions don’t succeed and millions of dollars alongwith national dreams burst into flames.

This suggests that the research field in the United States have witnessed an encouraging rise in the gender distribution among the PhD graduates.\nIn the current century, we have observed that the number of female PhD graduates are constantly on a rise and have even gone on to exceed the number of male PhD graduates in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nEven though women have had to face discrimination in the field of research, however, their story of persevering through the hardships and in large numbers as observed through their meteoric rise in the PhD graduates indicates that there is a flourishing and encouraging gender diversity among the PhD graduates in the United States today."

However, only in the academic year of 2005-06, we have observed that the number of female PhD graduates have now exceeded the number of male PhD graduates in The US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nThe year of 2005-06 indeed marks a major milestone in the higher education history of The United States where female PhD graduates have now outnumbered male PhD graduates, indicating a flourishing rise of gender diversity in the country. The number of female PhD graduates have continued to grow at a constant pace and have been observed to exceed the male graduates by nearly 20000 in the academic year of 2019-20."

    "text": "5.3 Can we use a better statistic to understand this data 🤔?\nWhile we have dealt with the raw number of PhD graduates for each gender so far, however, to make our understanding more intuitive, we rely upon the metric of gender ratio. Such a metric is often used as a key indicator to study the gender distribution. In our analysis, the gender ratio will be defined as the ratio of the number of female PhD graduates to the male PhD graduates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Change in gender ratio among US PhD graduates\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 provides a visual illustration of the constant rise in number of female PhD graduates in The United States.

This makes the analysis much more intuitive and easy to understand."

    "text": "The Brush-Tailed Bettong or Woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) is a remarkable Australian marsupial with unique characteristics. It thrives in a diverse range of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and shrublands, where dense vegetation offers shelter and sustenance. This nocturnal creature is most active during the night and rests in leafy grass nests during the day. Unfortunately, the Woylie has faced a perilous decline, with its population plummeting by more than 90% in the past two centuries. This decline can be attributed to various factors, including habitat loss, introduced predators, and disease. Consequently, the Woylie is currently classified as a critically endangered species, receiving protection from the Australian government. Most of the remaining Woylie population resides in wildlife sanctuaries, where they can live free from predators.The allure of encountering unique creatures in the wild has given rise to ecotourism, a sustainable form of tourism that emphasizes personal experiences with nature and promotes conservation. Given the Woylie’s elusive nature, our analysis seeks to understand the relationship between Woylie sightings and tourist visits\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The brush-tailed Bettong or Woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpectations for sightings and weather data\n\n\n\nFrom this data we expect the following results:\n\nWe expect to observe a decline in Woylie occurrences over the past 20 years, reflecting their critically endangered status.\nThe dataset is likely to show fewer sightings in the wild over recent years, given that Woylies are mostly found in protected sanctuaries.\nWoylies are expected to have limited sightings near weather stations, as their habitat preferences are specific to certain regions within Australia.\nWe anticipate a seasonal pattern in sightings, with more occurrences during specific times of the year, possibly correlating with breeding seasons or favorable climate conditions.\nIt is unlikely that there will be a significant number of sightings in urban areas, as Woylies tend to avoid human-populated regions due to habitat disturbance.\n\n\n\nIn our report we first analyse records from Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) database and check if they match our expectations, we also explore how weather is related to when Woylie sightings occur and find the region with most number of Woylie sightings. Further we perform an analysis that delves into the trends of tourism within that region. With respect to our analysis pertaining to the tourism trends, our expectations are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpectations for tourism data\n\n\n\n\nWe expect most of the Woylie sightings to either be in Western or Southern Australia.\nWe expect most number of holiday trips to be in September through November or March through May.\nWe expect a seasonal holiday pattern in the region of interest which may consequently lead to higher Woylie sightings."

Furthermore, we will evaluate whether visual inference techniques support or contradict our initial assumptions.\nNow, let’s move forward with exploring the data visually to acquire meaningful insights into the behavior and distribution of the Woylie.\n\n4.1.1 Trend in Woylie Sightings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The trend in Woylie Sightings Over Time\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows the trend in Woylie sightings over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nWe see that the actual trend is not aligning with our expectations, we see a relatively flat trend with minimal sightings from around 2000 up until approximately 2015 and a significant spike in sightings around 2020.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Geographical Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The five highest clusters of Woylie sightings.\n\n\n\n\nThe Leaflet map, initially featured in Section 3.2 and presented again in Figure 5, provides a clear geographic representation of Woylie sightings.\nWoylies exhibit distinct habitat preferences across various regions in Australia, and these preferences are closely associated with five specific weather stations: Gluepot Reserve, Nuriootpa Viticultural, North Shields (Port Lincoln Airport), Mildura Airport, and Narrabri Airport. These weather stations correspond to the following National Parks: Danggali Wilderness Protection area, Yookamura Private Nature Reserve, Lincoln National Park, Mallee Cliffs National Park, and Pilliga East State Forest.\nThe map starkly highlights the significant reduction in Woylie populations, stemming from challenges related to habitat loss and disease. Notably, it demonstrates the success of the population relocation strategy, which aims to guide Woylies towards conservation areas. The majority of Woylie clusters are now concentrated within the National Parks, as shown on the map.\nMoreover, the implementation of disease management programs is supported by evidence in Section 4.1.1, which indicates a recent upsurge in Woylie sightings in recent years. This increase can be attributed to the fact that these creatures are more readily observed within National Parks, further underscoring the effectiveness of this conservation approach."

The lowest number of sightings occurred in the winter months (April to September).\nThere are a few possible explanations for this pattern. One possibility is that Woylies are more active during the spring and summer months due to the warmer weather and longer days. Another possibility is that there is more food available for Woylies during the spring and summer months. Finally, it is also possible that Woylies are more visible during the spring and summer months because they are spending more time outside.\nTo delve into the connection between temperature and sightings, you have the option to craft scatter plots or line plots that unveil how temperature variables like ‘tmax’ or ‘tmin’ correlate with the observed number of sightings. Here’s an illustrative instance of crafting a plot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Temperature range on the days of Woylie sightings for each month of the year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nUpon analysing the maximum and minimum temperatures on the days of Woylie sightings as illustrated by Figure 7, we can obseve the following:\n\nThere appears to be lower number of Woylie sightings during the initial months of the year. The initial months in Australia constitute of the summer and is typically characterised by higher than average maximum and minimum temperatures. The low sightings during the summer suggests that the Woylies are not as active on warmer days.\nBetween the months of April to August, the number of Woylie sightings are observed to gradually rise. These months are relatively cold in Australia and appear to promote higher mobility among the Woylies.\nThere are distinctly higher number of observations from the month of September to December. This coincides with the Australian spring season. Based on the data, we can infer that the spring season appears to be the one promoting the highest activity among the Woylies."

The purpose of tourism trips will also be filtered to holiday trips since this suggests the intention to travel for sightseeing and exploration. Other purposes, such as visiting friends and relatives or business, may include visiting the endangered Woylie species during the trip, but the purposes are too broad to draw conclusive insights. Therefore, choosing holiday tourism data will result in the most accurate analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Total Holiday Trips in Narrabri Surrounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nBased on the initial analysis of Figure 14, the following observations can be made:\n\nThe number of trips designated as “holiday” is irregular, with several quarters and years showing no holiday visitors in the region of interest. However, after 2008, trips become more frequent.\nConsequently, there is only a moderate seasonality in holiday visits in this region.\nThe highest number of holiday visitors was recorded in the 3rd quarter of 2001, with nearly 13,445 visits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Holiday Tourism in Narrabri Surrounds by Year (1998 - 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to Figure 14, Figure 15 presents holiday tourism in a year calendar format to visualise and observe the annual tourism trend.

This recent, short surge in observations is too brief to correspond with the tourism data. This is evident from the highlighted quarter. It was the only quarter where trips involving over a thousand people occurred, which is also noticeable in the last calendar plot in Figure 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways\n\n\n\nBased on the analysis of Figure 17, the following key observations can be made:\n\nWhile the Narrabri region was found to have the highest Woylie sightings in Australia, this was not always the case.\nAccording to the sightings data from the Atlas of Living Australia, Woylie sightings in the Narrabri region were exclusively in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2022.\nRecognising this unique trend in the data, a more in-depth analysis was conducted to identify the underlying cause of this skewed pattern.\nAccording to a detailed report by the Australian wildlife organisation, Woylies, being an endangered species, are now inhabiting the protected Pilliga East Forest reserve, located in the Narrabri SA2 region.\nA significant number of Woylies were transferred from Western Australia to New South Wales (including the Narrabri region) in 2022, with the purpose of providing a safe environment for breeding and conservation efforts.\nThe special conservation initiatives undertaken by the Australian wildlife organisation, as mentioned in the points above, are expected to contribute to the high number of Woylie sightings in the year 2022.\n\n\n\nOverall, there is a limited relation between these two sets of data. It is evident that tourism in the Narrabri Surrounds area exhibits significant inconsistency and year-to-year variation. The peak in Woylie observations in Narrabri Surrounds toward the end of 2022 can be attributed to conservation efforts for this endangered species, resulting in a notable increase in sightings. However, the lack of alignment between these two time periods hinders further analysis. This suggests that tourism in the area may not be strongly linked to Woylie sightings, ultimately yielding an inconclusive result in terms of ecotourism.\nIn general, an internet search for terms such as “Pilliga State Conservation Area,” “Pilliga National Park”, “Woylie,” and “Narrabri Surrounds,” or a combination of these terms, yields minimal results related to marketing efforts promoting visits to the area for Woylie sightings.\nThis aligns with our findings, indicating that there is little to no ecotourism activity in this area for this particular species."

    "text": "Binary machine failure prediction using machine learning is a technique employed to anticipate the occurrence of failures or malfunctions in a binary system or machine. With the increasing complexity of modern machines, the ability to predict and prevent failures becomes crucial for optimizing performance, reducing downtime, and avoiding costly repairs.\nMachine learning algorithms play a vital role in this prediction process by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns or anomalies that indicate potential failures. These algorithms learn from past failure instances, considering various factors such as sensor readings, environmental conditions, maintenance records, and other relevant parameters.\nThe predictive models are trained on labeled datasets, where each instance is associated with a failure or non-failure outcome. Common machine learning techniques used for binary machine failure prediction include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.\nDuring the training phase, the algorithms learn the relationships between input features and failure occurrences, thereby enabling them to make accurate predictions on unseen data. Feature engineering, which involves selecting or transforming relevant input variables, is an essential step in improving the model’s performance.\nOnce the model is trained, it can be deployed to make real-time predictions on new data streams. By continuously monitoring machine inputs and comparing them to the learned patterns, the system can generate alerts or take preventive actions whenever a potential failure is detected. This proactive approach helps minimize unexpected downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall operational efficiency.\nBinary machine failure prediction using machine learning is widely applied across various industries, including manufacturing, power generation, healthcare, transportation, and more. By leveraging the power of data and advanced analytics, it offers a valuable tool for optimizing maintenance strategies, enhancing productivity, and ensuring the reliability of critical systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Source: www.gesrepair.com"

For this, we need to first zone in on the most important variables which we will be studying.

This will help us concentrate our EDA efforts only on the most important features.💡\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHowever, we need to think of an appropriate plot for us to visualise and understand the differences in the variables when it comes to EC1 and EC2 indicators. One such plot which can be used is the radar plot. The radar plot allows us to compare the standardised median or mean values for each variable while assessing the values for the EC1 and EC2 enzymes. Additionally, the radar plot is layered one over the other which gives us a better idea on the difference of the median standardised values and aids us to quickly understand any differences in the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Median standardised values for EC1 and EC2 indicators\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter analysing Figure 7, we observe that\n\n💡 The median standardised values for both EC1 and EC2 indicators are very similar. The major difference however can be observed for the variable PEOE_VSA7. EC2 is observed to demonstrate a relatively lower scaled value when compared to EC1.💡"
