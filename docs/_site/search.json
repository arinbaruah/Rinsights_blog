    "text": "5.1 Are we observing a rise in the popularity of research ?\nWhile the universities and research labs across the United States have historically produced some of the best researchers in the world, it is important to study the growth of these researchers. One of the ways to do so would be through analysing the number of graduating PhDs in the various fields of research.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of graduating PhDs in the US\n\n\n\n\nAs illustrated through Figure 1, we can observe a trend of rising PhD graduates in the United States. Between the years of 2008 to 2017, apart from the year of 2010, there has been a constant rise in the number of PhD students graduating across the various universities and research labs in the country. Since 2008 to 2017, we can observe a 12.6 % rise in the total number of graduating PhD students as per the statistics released by The National Science Foundation (NSF). The rise in these numbers can be attributed to the funding received in various fields of research, leading to higher recruitment and consequently, higher number of PhD graduates. This additionally makes the United States a very attractive study destination for the rest of the world. As a result, we can definitely observe a rise in the popularity of the research field in The United States of America."

While there has been an overall rise in the number of graduating PhDs as explained in Section 5.1, however, not all broad fields of research may observe the same growth in popularity. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of the total number of PhD graduates in each of the broad fields of research. We can observe that the field of Life Sciences attracts the highest number of PhDs while the least number of PhD graduates can be observed in the STEM field of Engineering.\nThe results corroborate with the findings of Meirmans et al. (2019) who have identified the field of biological life sciences to be the one with the highest fundings worldwide as these researches are directly related to various answering some of the toughest challenges to mankind such as curing cancer, eradication of polio, epidemic research as such COVID-19, and many such critical studies.\nOn the other hand, the field of engineering is observed to attract the least number of researchers. A part of the reason maybe due to the vast number of opportunities in the industry or the corporate which tends to attract more number of engineering graduates rather than the field of research.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: PhD graduates in each broad field"

As we can observe, there is indeed an uneven distribution of graduates in the various major fields of Life Sciences. We can observe that the number of graduates in the domain of biological and biomedical sciences is more than double the number of students in the second most popular field which is the field of Physics and astronomy.\n\nThis clearly suggests that the requirement for researchers and the funding available in the major field of biological and biomedical sciences is considerable higher than any other major field of Life Sciences."

However, similar to the distribution of Life Sciences, the PhD graduates in the field of Engineering are unevenly distributed with a clear trend in popularity for specific fields. As we can observe, the number of researchers in the field of Computer Engineering is much higher than the next popular field of Environmental Engineering.\n\nThis can be attributed to the recent advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Science, and many more state of the art technologies"

    "text": "5.1 Are we observing a shift towards more women in research ?\nIn order to answer this question, we need to look into the gender diversity among the PhD graduates in the previous century. Consequently, we will attempt to study the trend of the PhD graduates for the years prior to the year of 2000 and compare the current gender diversity in years after 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Change in gender diversity among PhD graduates in the US before and after 2000\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the number of male and female PhD graduates before and after the year 2000. We can observe that the number of male PhD graduates have remained fairly constant during the period between 1949-2000 while the number of female PhD graduates started from a very small group in 1950 but have been constantly on a rise till the end of the century. This suggests that the research field in the United States have witnessed an encouraging rise in the gender distribution among the PhD graduates.\nIn the current century, we have observed that the number of female PhD graduates are constantly on a rise and have even gone on to exceed the number of male PhD graduates in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nEven though women have had to face discrimination in the field of research, however, their story of persevering through the hardships and in large numbers as observed through their meteoric rise in the PhD graduates indicates that there is a flourishing and encouraging gender diversity among the PhD graduates in the United States today."

The number of female PhD graduates have continued to grow at a constant pace and have been observed to exceed the male graduates by nearly 20000 in the academic year of 2019-20."

Such a metric is often used as a key indicator to study the gender distribution. In our analysis, the gender ratio will be defined as the ratio of the number of female PhD graduates to the male PhD graduates.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Change in gender ratio among US PhD graduates\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 provides a visual illustration of the constant rise in number of female PhD graduates in The United States.

Diving deeper into the banking practices of Germany would provide a better understanding as to the reason for the high attrition of customers."

Contrary to belief, the percentage of churns are actually higher for accounts with positive balance as compared to zero balance accounts.\nThis could be due to the fact that account holders with zero balances are generally inactive and may not proactively close their accounts but rather, is done so by the bank to reduce the maintenance cost of keeping zero balance accounts active. However, account holders with positive balance may proactively choose to close their accounts due to various reasons as stated in Section 1 which may lead to the higher percentage of churned accounts."

    "text": "Binary machine failure prediction using machine learning is a technique employed to anticipate the occurrence of failures or malfunctions in a binary system or machine. With the increasing complexity of modern machines, the ability to predict and prevent failures becomes crucial for optimizing performance, reducing downtime, and avoiding costly repairs.\nMachine learning algorithms play a vital role in this prediction process by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns or anomalies that indicate potential failures. These algorithms learn from past failure instances, considering various factors such as sensor readings, environmental conditions, maintenance records, and other relevant parameters.\nThe predictive models are trained on labeled datasets, where each instance is associated with a failure or non-failure outcome. Common machine learning techniques used for binary machine failure prediction include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.\nDuring the training phase, the algorithms learn the relationships between input features and failure occurrences, thereby enabling them to make accurate predictions on unseen data. Feature engineering, which involves selecting or transforming relevant input variables, is an essential step in improving the model’s performance.\nOnce the model is trained, it can be deployed to make real-time predictions on new data streams. By continuously monitoring machine inputs and comparing them to the learned patterns, the system can generate alerts or take preventive actions whenever a potential failure is detected. This proactive approach helps minimize unexpected downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall operational efficiency.\nBinary machine failure prediction using machine learning is widely applied across various industries, including manufacturing, power generation, healthcare, transportation, and more. By leveraging the power of data and advanced analytics, it offers a valuable tool for optimizing maintenance strategies, enhancing productivity, and ensuring the reliability of critical systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Source: www.gesrepair.com"
