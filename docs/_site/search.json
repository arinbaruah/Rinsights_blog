    "text": "5.1 Are we observing a rise in the popularity of research ?\nWhile the universities and research labs across the United States have historically produced some of the best researchers in the world, it is important to study the growth of these researchers. One of the ways to do so would be through analysing the number of graduating PhDs in the various fields of research.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Number of graduating PhDs in the US\n\n\n\n\nAs illustrated through Figure¬†1, we can observe a trend of rising PhD graduates in the United States. Between the years of 2008 to 2017, apart from the year of 2010, there has been a constant rise in the number of PhD students graduating across the various universities and research labs in the country. Since 2008 to 2017, we can observe a 12.6 % rise in the total number of graduating PhD students as per the statistics released by The National Science Foundation (NSF). The rise in these numbers can be attributed to the funding received in various fields of research, leading to higher recruitment and consequently, higher number of PhD graduates. This additionally makes the United States a very attractive study destination for the rest of the world. As a result, we can definitely observe a rise in the popularity of the research field in The United States of America."

While there has been an overall rise in the number of graduating PhDs as explained in Section¬†5.1, however, not all broad fields of research may observe the same growth in popularity. Figure¬†2 illustrates the distribution of the total number of PhD graduates in each of the broad fields of research. We can observe that the field of Life Sciences attracts the highest number of PhDs while the least number of PhD graduates can be observed in the STEM field of Engineering.\nThe results corroborate with the findings of Meirmans et al. (2019) who have identified the field of biological life sciences to be the one with the highest fundings worldwide as these researches are directly related to various answering some of the toughest challenges to mankind such as curing cancer, eradication of polio, epidemic research as such COVID-19, and many such critical studies.\nOn the other hand, the field of engineering is observed to attract the least number of researchers. A part of the reason maybe due to the vast number of opportunities in the industry or the corporate which tends to attract more number of engineering graduates rather than the field of research.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: PhD graduates in each broad field"

As we can observe, there is indeed an uneven distribution of graduates in the various major fields of Life Sciences. We can observe that the number of graduates in the domain of biological and biomedical sciences is more than double the number of students in the second most popular field which is the field of Physics and astronomy.\n\nThis clearly suggests that the requirement for researchers and the funding available in the major field of biological and biomedical sciences is considerable higher than any other major field of Life Sciences."

However, similar to the distribution of Life Sciences, the PhD graduates in the field of Engineering are unevenly distributed with a clear trend in popularity for specific fields. As we can observe, the number of researchers in the field of Computer Engineering is much higher than the next popular field of Environmental Engineering.\n\nThis can be attributed to the recent advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Science, and many more state of the art technologies"

Consequently, we will attempt to study the trend of the PhD graduates for the years prior to the year of 2000 and compare the current gender diversity in years after 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Change in gender diversity among PhD graduates in the US before and after 2000\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1 illustrates the number of male and female PhD graduates before and after the year 2000. We can observe that the number of male PhD graduates have remained fairly constant during the period between 1949-2000 while the number of female PhD graduates started from a very small group in 1950 but have been constantly on a rise till the end of the century. This suggests that the research field in the United States have witnessed an encouraging rise in the gender distribution among the PhD graduates.\nIn the current century, we have observed that the number of female PhD graduates are constantly on a rise and have even gone on to exceed the number of male PhD graduates in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nEven though women have had to face discrimination in the field of research, however, their story of persevering through the hardships and in large numbers as observed through their meteoric rise in the PhD graduates indicates that there is a flourishing and encouraging gender diversity among the PhD graduates in the United States today."

Contrary to belief, the percentage of churns are actually higher for accounts with positive balance as compared to zero balance accounts.\nThis could be due to the fact that account holders with zero balances are generally inactive and may not proactively close their accounts but rather, is done so by the bank to reduce the maintenance cost of keeping zero balance accounts active. However, account holders with positive balance may proactively choose to close their accounts due to various reasons as stated in Section¬†1 which may lead to the higher percentage of churned accounts."

The Taipan, scientifically known as the Oxyuranus genus, comprises several species, with the Coastal Taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) and the Inland Taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus) being the most renowned. These reptiles are highly venomous and belong to the elapid family, which includes other infamous snakes like the king cobra and the black mamba. According to Markwell and Cushing (2016), what sets the taipan apart, however, is its reputation as having the most toxic venom of any snake in the world !\nIn our current analysis, we will be focusing on the occurrences of a specific subspecies of the Coastal Taipan across the various states of Australia. The subgroup of the Coastal Taipans which has been scientifically named as Oxyuranus Scutellatus Scutellatus, is commonly found in the northern regions of Australia and is renowned for its agility and speed. It primarily feeds on small mammals, birds, and occasionally reptiles, using its potent venom to immobilize its prey swiftly.\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: The coastal taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus)\n\n\nCharacterized by its slender body, shiny scales, and formidable fangs, the Taipan is a formidable predator. Despite its fearsome reputation, these snakes are generally reclusive and rarely encountered by humans. They prefer to inhabit coastal regions, woodlands, and savannas, blending seamlessly into their natural surroundings as can be observed in Figure¬†1.\nWhile the Coastal Taipans are not classified as endangered species, however, with rapid human activities such as urbanisation and encroachment of wildlife area for agricultural purposes, the habitat of these reptiles have been increasingly affected as a result of which, steps have been taken by wild life conservationists to preserve their natural habitats to the best extent possible.\n\n1.1 Data source:\n\nThe data was sourced from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) using the galah R package.\nThe weather station data to study impact of weather conditions on sightings was sourced from National Climatic Data Centre (NCDC) using rnoaa package in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey assumptions\n\n\n\nBased on the literature surveys for the Coastal Taipan, here are our assumptions while moving forward with our analysis:\n\nBased on the information from the Australia Museum, the Coastal Taipans are active throughout the year but are observed to be most commonly encountered during late winter to spring (August to December of a calendar year).\nAs can be inferred from its colloquial name, the Coastal Taipans are often observed in the coastal regions of Australia.\nBased on a study by Billabong Sanctuary, the Coastal Taipans are not endangered and have probably increased in numbers due to the growth in the number of rats (who are the primary prey) in areas close to the human settlements.\nCoastal Taipans depend primarily on their venom as their defensive mechanism and consider human interactions as an act of aggression. Consequently, the number of sightings across Australia can be considered to be limited to certain regions and in small numbers.\nThe Coastal Taipans, like any other snakes are territorial in nature and do not migrate from their region over the years.\n\n\n\nAlthough we will attempt to accurately analyse the data by obtaining it from reliable repositories, however, it is important to consider the limitations of the dataset while making critical conclusions based on the data in hand. Some of the limitations of the current dataset are delineated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of the data\n\n\n\n\nSince the data which has been obtained from the Atlast of Living Australia falls under the category of observational data, there could be instances of missing values. These instances will need to be filtered out while analysing the data from the repository.\nSince the data is obtained from various sources, there could be inconsistencies in reporting the data.\nWhile the data collection was done in an extensive and granular manner, there could be a lack of precision of the observations made for the exact latitude and longitude.\nThe dataset obtained from the Atlas of Living Australia only reports for all the Coastal Taipans that have been sighted and recorded. Hence, it does not report the entire population of these reptiles across the various regions of Australia. This may lead to inaccurate conclusions post analysis of the limited data in hand.\nThe dataset here consist of observational data and in particular, occurrences data. Some of the limitations that are prevalent in such datasets are as follows :\n\nThe data here is obtained from various sources. As a result, there may be non-uniformity in the data provided. Each reporting authority may have their own interpretations of the data they may have provided.\nThe current dataset obtained is a subset of an observational data. These types of data are often plagued with lack of randomisation during the selection of data. This may lead to biases in the dataset such as selection and systematic bias.\nThe data maybe misclassified or filled in non-uniform units by the various sources, leading to lack of accuracy of the overall dataset."

For latitude (-90 to 90) and for longitude (-180 to 180). This would help detect any unusual or erroneous data points.\nConsistency Checks: Make sure there aren‚Äôt any discrepancies in the way data is represented across rows.\nMissing Value Analysis: Any missing values should be analyzed to understand the reason behind them.\nDate Consistency: Ensure that the event dates fall within expected ranges and are formatted correctly.\n\n\n\n3.3 Data Quality Check\n\nvis_miss(taipan)\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Representation of missing values in the dataset\n\n\n\n\nThe vis_miss() function from the ‚Äúvisdat‚Äù package provides a visual representation of missing data in the dataset.\nThe plot illustrated in Figure¬†2 indicates that about half of the total dataset has missing values. These missing values can be observed majorly in the variables of eventRemarks,eventTime and eventID. In order to improve the quality of the overall data, we will consider either transforming these variables or removing them as a part of feature selection in the following sections.\n\nlat_summary &lt;- taipan$decimalLatitude %&gt;% fivenum()\nlong_summary &lt;- taipan$decimalLongitude %&gt;% fivenum()\n\nsummary_table &lt;- tibble(\n  Statistic = c(\"Minimum\", \"1st Quartile\", \"Median\", \"3rd Quartile\", \"Maximum\"),\n  Latitude = lat_summary,\n  Longitude = long_summary\n) \n\nkable(summary_table, format = \"html\", table.attr = \"class='table'\") %&gt;% \n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), position = \"center\") %&gt;%\n  column_spec(1, border_right = TRUE) %&gt;%  # Add a line between columns\n  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = \"white\", background = \"lightblue\")\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Representation of five number summary of values in the dataset\n\n\nStatistic\nLatitude\nLongitude\n\n\n\n\nMinimum\n-28.16667\n131.1667\n\n\n1st Quartile\n-25.74854\n145.2500\n\n\nMedian\n-17.93333\n145.9833\n\n\n3rd Quartile\n-15.46667\n152.2000\n\n\nMaximum\n-10.88333\n154.4333\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fivenum() function in R provides a summary of five-number statistics: the minimum, lower-hinge (25th percentile or first quartile), median (50th percentile), upper-hinge (75th percentile or third quartile), and the maximum.\nBy analyzing these statistics in Table¬†1, we can get an overview of the distribution of latitudes and longitudes in the dataset. The five number summary of the latitude and longitude values further allows us to validate the values with each latitude and longitude observation being within the maximum and minimum possible limits.\n\n\n3.4 Data transformation and feature selection\nAs we are primarily interested in analysing the wild sightings of the Coastal Taipans across Australia, hence, we will filter out the data obtained from museums and animal sanctuaries. This information has been provided in the event ID column which will be used to filter the required data as shown in the code chunk below. It has been additionally assumed that the occurrences with no mention of the term ‚Äúmuseum‚Äù have been considered as wild sightings in the context of the current study.\n\ntaipan &lt;- taipan %&gt;% mutate(occurrence = if_else(str_detect(taipan$eventID,\"museum\"),\"Museum\",\"Wild\"))\ntaipan$occurrence &lt;- replace_na(taipan$occurrence,\"Wild\")\n\ntaipan_occurrs &lt;- taipan %&gt;% group_by(occurrence) %&gt;% summarise(Count =  n())  \n\nggplot(taipan_occurrs, aes(x = occurrence,y = Count)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = occurrence)) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings\",\n       x = \"Occurrence Type\",\n       y = \"Number of sightings\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + geom_label(aes(label =Count))\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia\n\n\n\n\nFigure Figure¬†3 displays the distribution of Taipan sightings categorized into two types: Museum and Wild. It‚Äôs evident from the figure that a portion of the data is sourced from museums, which means these observations don‚Äôt represent the natural behavior or occurrence of Taipans in their wild habitats.\nFor a comprehensive study of the natural behavior or occurrence patterns of Taipans, it‚Äôs pertinent to focus solely on the ‚ÄúWild‚Äù type data.\n\n # Selecting only wild occurrences of Coastal Taipans\ntaipan_wild &lt;- taipan %&gt;% filter(occurrence ==\"Wild\")\n\nWe have observed a total of 240 occurrences across Australia. However, this number has been obtained from the raw data which will need to be cleaned further.\n\nBased on the initial data analysis, we will need to perform the following data cleaning operations:\n\nFilter the data with valid sighting date for detailed temporal analysis.\nFilter the data with valid values of longitude and latitude for detailed spatial analysis.\n\n\n\ntaipan_wild &lt;- taipan_wild %&gt;% \n  rename(Longitude = decimalLongitude,\n         Latitude = decimalLatitude) %&gt;%\n  mutate(eventDate = as.Date(eventDate)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(eventDate)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Longitude)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Latitude)) %&gt;% select(-c(\"samplingEffort\",\"samplingProtocol\",\"taxonConceptID\",\"recordID\",\"dataResourceName\"))\nsave(taipan_wild, file=here::here(\"data/taipan.rda\"))\n\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏èüí° Upon performing the required data cleaning operation, we have a total of 100 wild sightings of Coastal Taipans across Australia. üí°‚ÄºÔ∏è\n\n\n3.4.1 Combining data of sightings with weather data ‚õàÔ∏è\nIn order to explore the prevailing weather conditions during the sighting, we will need to merge the datasets from two different sources. Here, we will utilise the weather data reported from the various weather stations in Australia by utilising the RNOAA package which is maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The following code chunk allows us to obtain the weather conditions, namely precipitation (PRCP), maximum temperature (TMAX) and minimum temperature (TMIN). In order to utilise data from active weather stations, we have filtered those data whose last reported conditions were relayed after the year of 2020.\n\naus_stations &lt;- ghcnd_stations() |&gt;\n  filter(str_starts(id, \"ASN\")) |&gt;\n  filter(last_year &gt;= 2020) |&gt;\n  mutate(wmo_id = as.numeric(wmo_id),\n         name = str_to_lower(name)) |&gt;\n  select(-state, -gsn_flag) |&gt;\n  filter(element %in% c(\"PRCP\", \"TMAX\", \"TMIN\")) |&gt;\n  nest(element: last_year) |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  filter(nrow(data) == 3) |&gt;\n  select(-data) \n\nOnce we have obtained the weather data, we need to merge the sighting data with the weather conditions. For this purpose, we can utilise the geographical data (latitude and longitude) to merge the closest weather station data with the location of the Coastal Taipan sighting.\n\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Since it is difficult to exactly match the latitude and longitude of the sighting to the weather station, hence, we will convert the geographical data into spatial objects and then utilise the nearest feature function to merge the weather conditions of the location of the sighting to the closest weather reporting station. This has been done in the following code chunk. ‚ÄºÔ∏è\n\n\n# Convert the datasets into spatial objects\ntaipan_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(taipan_wild, coords = c(\"Longitude\", \"Latitude\"), crs = 4326)\naus_stations_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(aus_stations, coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\n# Perform the nearest neighbor join\nnearest_stations &lt;- st_nearest_feature(taipan_sf, aus_stations_sf)\n\n# Combine the datasets\ncombined_data &lt;- cbind(taipan_wild, aus_stations[nearest_stations, ])\n\ncombined_data &lt;- as.data.frame(combined_data)\nunique_id &lt;- unique(combined_data$id)\n\nOnce we have successfully mapped the sighting data with each of the weather stations, let us try to observe the most frequent sightings with respect to its closest weather station.\n\ncombined_count &lt;- combined_data %&gt;% group_by(name) %&gt;% summarise(Count = n())\ntop_2 &lt;- c(\"cooktown airport\",\"townsville aero\")\n\nggplot(combined_count,aes(x = reorder(name,Count),y = Count)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + theme_classic() + ggtitle(\"Number of Coastal Taipan sightings \\n for each weather station\")  + geom_label(data = ~filter(.x, name %in% top_2),aes(label = Count),vjust=0.8) +  labs(x = \"Weather station name\",y = \"Number of Coastal Taipan sightings\",caption = \"Source: National Climatic Data Center and Atlas of Living Australia\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Number of sightings for each weather station\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4 illustrates the number of Coastal Taipan sightings for each of the weather stations in Australia. Based on the illustration, we will be able to narrow down our search for the location with frequent sightings of the reptile and can drill down our analysis to obtain weather information.\nHere, we observe that the weather stations Cooktown Airport and Townsville Aero have significantly higher number of sightings when compared to the rest of the data. Let us pull the weather information for these weather stations through the below code chunk.\n\nnarrogin &lt;- aus_stations |&gt;\n  filter(name %in% top_2) |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(ts = list(meteo_pull_monitors(\n    monitors = id, var = c(\"PRCP\", \"TMAX\", \"TMIN\"),\n    date_min = \"1950-01-01\",\n    date_max = \"2023-09-13\") |&gt;\n      select(-id))) |&gt;\n  rename(Latitude = latitude, Longitude = longitude, elev = elevation) |&gt; select(id, Longitude, Latitude, elev, name, wmo_id, ts) %&gt;%\n  unnest(ts) |&gt;\n  mutate(tmax = tmax/10, tmin = tmin/ 10)\n\nIn the next part, we will create a new variable called sighting with values of either 0 or 1 to mark the sighting of the Coastal Taipan. This variable is important because,\n\nthe weather data obtained is for all the possible dates which match our time period filter. This does not necessarily mean that a Coastal Taipan was observed on that particular day. Hence, upon merging the weather and the sighting dataset, it is important to distinguish the days (obtained by eventDate) which mark the sighting of a Coastal Taipan. We will be primarily interested to analyse the prevailing weather conditions on these particular days for the choice of our weather stations.\n\n\nsubset_combined_data &lt;- combined_data %&gt;% filter(name %in% top_2)\ntaipan_weather &lt;- right_join(subset_combined_data,narrogin,by = c(\"id\",\"eventDate\"=\"date\"))\ntaipan_weather &lt;- taipan_weather %&gt;% mutate(sighting = if_else(!is.na(occurrenceStatus) ,1,0))\nsave(taipan_weather, file=here::here(\"data/taipan_weather_sighting.rda\"))"

We can observe that the sightings are higher between the months of July to December when compared to the rest of the year. This can be a result of the prevailing monsoon conditions in Australia which closely corroborates with our assumption stated in Section¬†1.\nSome of the reasons why the Coastal Taipans are observed to be more active are as follows:\n\nBreeding season: The Coastal Taipans are highly active during the breeding season which closely conincides with the monsoon season in Australia.\nIncreased prey availability: The monsoon season in northern Australia typically brings heavy rainfall, which can lead to flooding in some areas. This flooding forces small mammals, reptiles, and other prey animals out of their burrows and hiding places, making them more accessible to Coastal Taipans. The increased prey availability during the monsoon can lead to an uptick in snake activity as they take advantage of the abundance of food.\nTemperature and humidity: Reptiles are ectothermic in nature, meaning their body temperature is highly influenced by the environmental temperature. Monsoon season generally brings about warm and humid conditions. These conditions additionally improve the metabolism and mobility in reptiles which allows for higher activity and increased number of Coastal Taipan sightings.\nMigratory behaviour: Due to increased mobility in the reptiles during the monsoon season, some Coastal Taipans exhibit migrate behaviour for better conditions and availability of prey. Migrations can often lead to human interactions and hence, their consequent sightings.\n\nüí°\n\n\n\n4.2 Where are the Coastal Taipans most commonly observed in Australia?\n\n# Assuming your dataset is named `sightings` and has columns `latitude` and `longitude`\nleaflet(data = taipan) %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;%\n  addCircles(lng = ~decimalLongitude, lat = ~decimalLatitude, popup = paste(\"Scientific name:\",taipan$scientificName, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                              \"Latitude:\",taipan$decimalLatitude,\"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                              \"Longitude:\",taipan$decimalLongitude,\"&lt;br&gt;\"), radius = 50, color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: Regions of Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia\n\n\n\n\nsourceSightings &lt;- taipan %&gt;% \n                   group_by(dataResourceName) %&gt;% \n                   summarise(count = n())\ncolnames(sourceSightings) &lt;- c(\"Data Source\", \"Number of Sightings\")\n\nkable(sourceSightings, format = \"html\", table.attr = \"class='table'\") %&gt;% \n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), position = \"center\") %&gt;%\n  column_spec(1, border_right = TRUE) %&gt;%  # Add a line between columns\n  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = \"white\", background = \"lightblue\")\n\n\n\nTable¬†2: Number of sightings reported by each data source\n\n\nData Source\nNumber of Sightings\n\n\n\n\nALA species sightings and OzAtlas\n1\n\n\nAustralian Museum provider for OZCAM\n2\n\n\nQueensland Museum provider for OZCAM\n236\n\n\niNaturalist Australia\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6 illustrates that, in alignment with its name, most Coastal Taipan sightings occur in coastal regions. Additionally, considering that a significant portion of the data comes from the ‚ÄúQueensland Museum provider for OZCAM‚Äù as observed by Table¬†2, it can be determined that a majority of these sightings are concentrated in the coastal areas of Queensland. It is also particularly interesting to note that one sighting observed in the Northern Territory indicating a possibility of migration and future possibilities of higher sightings in this region.\n\nüí°üí° The Coastal Taipan‚Äôs preference for coastal regions in Australia can be attributed to the habitat, climate, and prey availability in these areas. Coastal regions provide a favorable environment with adequate warmth, humidity, and shelter. These conditions are conducive for the Taipan‚Äôs survival and reproduction. Additionally, coastal areas offer a rich biodiversity, ensuring ample prey for the snake. The vegetation in these regions, like grasslands and woodlands, offers suitable hiding spots for the snake and its prey, leading to a higher likelihood of the Taipan being found in these areas.\n\n\n\n4.3 Has there been a rise in the number of Coastal Taipans in Australia over the years?\n\npopulation_count &lt;- taipan_wild %&gt;% \n  mutate(year = year(eventDate)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  filter(year != \"1915\") %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\ntrend &lt;- ggplot(population_count, aes(x = year, y = count)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = \"Yearly Count\"), linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(color = \"Trend Line\"), method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, size = 1.5,linetype = 'dashed') +\n  labs(title = \"Trend of Coastal Taipan Sightings Over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Sightings\",\n       color = \"Legend\") +\n  theme_classic()\nggplotly(trend)\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Trend of Coastal Taipan Sightings Over the years of 1915-2020\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7 demonstrates a noticeable increase in sightings over the years, potentially suggesting a growth in the Coastal Taipan population, indicating they might not be ‚Äúendangered‚Äù. However, there are caveats to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\n\nSightings vs.¬†Population: The number of sightings does not necessarily equate to the actual population. An increase in sightings could be due to increased human activity in the taipan‚Äôs habitat or better reporting mechanisms.\nIncomplete Data: The dataset might not cover all sightings, especially as it has limited data sources or regions.\nExternal Factors: Factors like urban development, habitat destruction, or climate change can influence the habitats and distribution of species, which can subsequently influence sighting reports.\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Are the Coastal Taipans limited to certain regions of Australia ?\nIn Section¬†4.2, we were able to observe that the Coastal Taipans are observed to be sighted close to the coasts. In this section, we will be focused on assessing whether the sighting locations of the Coastal Taipans suggest that these reptiles are limited to certain regions of Australia only. The same will be assessed through the generation of a null plot and testing a hypothesis. The hypothesis and the null generating mechanism are as follows:\n\n\\(H_o\\) : Coastal Taipans are not limited to a single region and can be sighted all over Australia.\n\\(H_1\\) : Coastal Taipans are limited to certain regions of Australia, particularly in humid and warm conditions.\nNull generating mechanism: Usage of the ‚Äúnull_permute‚Äù function to permute the latitude values of the Coastal Taipan sightings.\n\n\nset.seed(1232536)\naustralia_map &lt;- map_data(\"world\", region = \"Australia\")\n\n\n# Overlay the soccer pitch as a custom annotation on the scatter plot\nmap_null_plot &lt;- ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = australia_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n   geom_point(data = lineup(null_permute(\"Latitude\"),taipan_wild, n = 20),\n                      aes(x = Longitude,y = Latitude),color = \"red\",alpha = 0.4) + facet_wrap(~.sample) + theme_classic() + theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank())\nmap_null_plot\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†8: Null lineup plot for occurrences of Coastal Taipan sightings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nUpon analysing the plot null lineup plots in Figure¬†8, we observed that of the 8 test cases, 7 people were able to recognise the plot 4 as the most unique plot due to the scatter points (sighting locations) being limited to only the coastal regions of Australia. The P-value for the following result is 5.9765626^{-9} which suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected and we can conclude that there is significant evidence in the data to suggest that Coastal Taipans are majorly limited to the North-Eastern coast of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Has the geographical distribution of Coastal Taipans remained consistent over the years?\nSnakes are typically reclusive and territorial. Given this characteristic, it‚Äôs intriguing to consider whether coastal taipans exhibit similar behavior. Specifically, it‚Äôs of interest to determine if coastal taipans remain in their established habitats due to their inherent nature or external factors or if there are distinct regions they consistently inhabit. This investigation will be facilitated by generating a null plot and conducting hypothesis testing. The pertinent hypotheses and the mechanism for generating the null distribution are outlined as follows:\n\n\\(H_o\\): The geographical distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings has remained consistent over the years, with no significant difference in distribution between the periods pre-2000s and post-2000s.\n\\(H_1\\): The geographical distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings has changed between the periods pre-2000s and post-2000s.\nNull generating mechanism: Usage of the ‚Äúnull_permute‚Äù function to permute the eventCategory (Pre or Post 2000s categorisation) values of the Coastal Taipan sightings.\n\n\ntaipan_wild &lt;- taipan_wild %&gt;%\n  mutate(eventCategory = ifelse(year(eventDate) &lt; 2000, \"pre-2000s\", \"post-2000s\"))\n\nset.seed(201349)\n\nggplot(lineup(null_permute('eventCategory'), taipan_wild), aes(x = Longitude, y= Latitude, color = eventCategory), n=20) +\n  borders(\"world\", regions = \"Australia\", fill = \"white\", colour = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~ .sample, nrow = 2) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†9: Null Distribution of Taipan Sightings by Location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nUpon analysing the plot null lineup plots in Figure¬†9, we observed that of the 8 test cases, only 2 people were able to recognise the plot 19 as the most unique plot due to the scatter points being limited to only the coastal regions of Australia. The P-value for the following result is 0.0572447 which suggests that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected based on 95% confidence and we can conclude that there is significant evidence in the data to suggest that Coastal Taipans are consistently sighted in the same regions in Australia over the years.\n\n\n\n\n4.6 How are the weather conditions like in the areas with Coastal Taipan sightings ?\nIn this section, we will be interested to find any insights with respect to the weather in the locations with high Coastal Taipan sightings.\n\n4.6.1 Does rain play a role in the sightings of the Coastal Taipans ? ‚õàÔ∏è\n\ntaipan_rain &lt;- taipan_weather %&gt;% filter(sighting == 1) %&gt;% mutate(rain = if_else(!is.na(prcp) & prcp&gt; 0,\"Rain recorded\",\"No rain recorded\"))\n\ntaipan_rain_group &lt;-\n  taipan_rain %&gt;% group_by(rain) %&gt;% summarise(Total = n())\nrain_plot &lt;-\n  ggplot(data = taipan_rain_group, aes(\n    x = as.factor(rain),\n    y = Total,\n    fill = factor(rain)\n  )) + geom_col(color='black') + geom_label(aes(label = Total)) + theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rain indication for the day of sighting\",y = \"Total number of sightings\")\nrain_plot + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†10: Number of Coastal Taipan sightings on days of observed precipitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nBased on our analysis of Figure¬†10, we can observe that of the 27 observations, 23 of the sightings took place on days with no recorded precipitation while only 4 sightings took place on days with recorded precipitation. This suggests that the precipitation may not have a strong association with the Coastal Taipan sightings. However, it must also be kept in mind that the current sample of the dataset is too small to generate any strong conclusions from the data and we may require further data to support our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n4.6.2 How are the temperatures during the days of sightings ? ‚òÄÔ∏è\nLet us now explore the minimum and maximum temperatures on the given day of Coastal Taipan sightings and analyse any further insights.\n\ntaipan_weather1 &lt;- taipan_weather %&gt;% filter(sighting == 1) \ntaipan_weather1 &lt;- taipan_weather1 %&gt;% mutate(observation = 1:nrow(taipan_weather1))\ntaipan_weather1$observation &lt;- factor(taipan_weather1$observation)\npl_temp &lt;- ggplot(taipan_weather1, aes(y = observation)) +\n  geom_dumbbell(aes(x = tmin, xend = tmax),\n                color = \"darkgray\",\n                size = 1, dot_guide = FALSE, \n                size_x = 3,  size_xend = 3,\n                colour_xend = \"#F69541\", colour_x = \"#699DC6\") +\n    geom_text(aes(x = tmin, label = tmin), hjust = 1.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = tmax, label = tmax), hjust = -0.2) +\n  xlim(0,40) + labs(x = \"Minimum and maximum temperatures observed (degree Celsius)\",\n                                      y = \"Coastal Taipan sighting unique observation\")  + theme_classic()\n   \npl_temp + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(taipan_weather1$tmax,na.rm = TRUE),alpha = 0.5,linetype =2,color = 'red') +  \n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(taipan_weather1$tmin,na.rm = TRUE),alpha = 0.5,linetype =2,color = 'blue') +\n    scale_linetype_manual(values = \"Mean Temperature\", name = \"Line Type\") +\n    annotate(\n    \"text\",\n    x = 35,\n    y = 8,\n    colour = \"red\",\n    label = paste0(\"Average maximum temperature:\",round(mean(taipan_weather1$tmax,na.rm = TRUE),1)),\n    size = unit(3, \"pt\") \n  ) +\n      annotate(\n    \"text\",\n    x = 5,\n    y = 14,\n    colour = \"blue\",\n    label = paste0(\"Average minimum temperature:\",round(mean(taipan_weather1$tmin,na.rm = TRUE),1)),\n    size = unit(3, \"pt\")\n      )\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†11: Temperature range on the days of Coastal Taipan sightings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaway\n\n\n\nUpon analysing the maximum and minimum temperatures on the days of Coastal Taipan sightings as illustrated by Figure¬†11, we can observe that the majority of the sightings were recorded on days with relatively higher maximum and minimum temperatures. This suggests that the mobility of the reptiles are higher during warmer conditions leading to higher probability of their sightings. Higher temperatures also induce lower mobility among the prey of the Taipans to protect themselves from the heat, as a result of which, the reptiles are also on the move to hunt.\nThe average maximum and minimum temperatures visualised by the two vertical lines in the plot are 28.1 and 19 degree celsius respectively, suggesting warm conditions."

    "text": "5 Summary\nBased on our detailed analysis of the Coastal Taipan sightings, following are our key takeaways:\n\nüí°üí°\n\n\nThe spatial analysis suggests that the Coastal Taipans are territorial in nature, thereby inhabiting the coastal regions of Queensland with possibility of migration towards Northern Territory in the future.\nBased on the frequency of sightings, the Coastal Taipans are not endagered. However, they are extremely reclusive and avoid human contact. Hence, their occurrences and sightings are rare as they are mostly confined to their habitats.\nWhile migration of the Coastal Taipans maybe a possibility in the future, based on the data, there is not enough strong evidence to suggest that there has been a significant change in the Coastal Taipan‚Äôs habitat.\nContrary to popular belief, the data does not exhibit a strong evidence to suggest that the sightings of Coastal Taipans are higher on days of recorded precipitation. However, the Coastal Taipans do exhibit higher mobility during the monsoon period resulting in higher sightings.\nCoastal Taipans appear to be especially active on warm days, possibly due to their increased mobility and metabolism, consequently resulting in higher sightings on these days.\n\nüí°üí°"

    "text": "Binary machine failure prediction using machine learning is a technique employed to anticipate the occurrence of failures or malfunctions in a binary system or machine. With the increasing complexity of modern machines, the ability to predict and prevent failures becomes crucial for optimizing performance, reducing downtime, and avoiding costly repairs.\nMachine learning algorithms play a vital role in this prediction process by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns or anomalies that indicate potential failures. These algorithms learn from past failure instances, considering various factors such as sensor readings, environmental conditions, maintenance records, and other relevant parameters.\nThe predictive models are trained on labeled datasets, where each instance is associated with a failure or non-failure outcome. Common machine learning techniques used for binary machine failure prediction include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.\nDuring the training phase, the algorithms learn the relationships between input features and failure occurrences, thereby enabling them to make accurate predictions on unseen data. Feature engineering, which involves selecting or transforming relevant input variables, is an essential step in improving the model‚Äôs performance.\nOnce the model is trained, it can be deployed to make real-time predictions on new data streams. By continuously monitoring machine inputs and comparing them to the learned patterns, the system can generate alerts or take preventive actions whenever a potential failure is detected. This proactive approach helps minimize unexpected downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall operational efficiency.\nBinary machine failure prediction using machine learning is widely applied across various industries, including manufacturing, power generation, healthcare, transportation, and more. By leveraging the power of data and advanced analytics, it offers a valuable tool for optimizing maintenance strategies, enhancing productivity, and ensuring the reliability of critical systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Source: www.gesrepair.com"

    "text": "4.2 Air and process temperatures\nTemperatures can play a critical role in relation to machine health. In this dataset, we have air and process temperatures. The difference of these values could allow us to understand the overall heat dissipation of the machines. Analysing these variables may allow us when do the machines undergo overall failure as well as heat dissipation failure (HDF).\nLet us first study the distribution of the temperature values.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Temperature variation distribution\n\n\n\n\nAs we can observe from Figure¬†4, majority of the heat dissipation failures have occurred at relatively higher values of air temperatures. These air temperatures are observed to be around 302.5 K. Higher air temperatures invariably leads to lower value of heat dissipation which may cause heat dissipation failure and subsequently, machine failure.\nHeat dissipation values are governed by the following heat transfer equation.\n\\[ \\boxed{\\Delta H = mC_p(T_{process} - T_{air})}\\] Based on the above equation, let us now study how the difference between process and air temperatures vary for heat dissipation failures.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Heat dissipation failure based on temperature difference\n\n\n\n\nAs illustrated by figure Figure¬†5 and based on the heat transfer equation, we can observe that\n\n ‚ö†Ô∏è the majority of the heat dissipation failures occur at low temperature differences between process and air temperatures. ‚ö†Ô∏è  ."

As a result of torque applied, a machine element, such as the tool in this case rotates at a particular speed. This speed of rotation is measured by the tool rotation speed in revolutions per minute (RPM).\nIn addition to the above definitions, the product of the torque and the tool rotation speeds give us the value of the power consumption of a machine. The equaiton for the same is as follows :\n\\[ \\boxed{P = \\omega T} \\] Where,\n\\(P =\\) Power consumption of the machine in Watts\n\\(T =\\) Torque in Nm\n\\(\\omega = 2\\pi N/60\\), with \\(N\\) being the tool rotational speed (RPM)\n\nLet us now visualise the torque and tool rotation speed values for each machine type.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: Working window of Torque and Rotational speeds\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plot in figure Figure¬†6, we can observe\n\n ‚ö†Ô∏èThe ideal working window for torque lies between 25 Nm - 50 Nm while that for the rotational speed lies between 1250-2000 RPM . ‚ö†Ô∏è  .\n\nLet us now try to study how do the values for tool rotation speeds and torque vary based on power failure (PWF) faceted for each machine type.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Faceted hex plot of working windows for each machine type\n\n\n\n\nBased on the analysis of figure Figure¬†7 we can conclude that\n\n‚ùå Power failures (PWF) are observed to majorly occur outside the ideal working window.

    "text": "2.2 Deeper analysis into passes of each team\nWhile we couldn‚Äôt find signficant difference in the pass lengths of each teams, however, can we observe any interesting insights for the long passes made by each team ?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†8: Long passes by Australia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†9: Long passes by Brazil\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on our analysis of Figure¬†8 and Figure¬†9, we can make the following observations:\n\nMost long passes for Australia originated from the Goalkeeper‚Äôs position\nOn the other hand, Brazil‚Äôs long passes originated from the defense. This suggests that Brazil employed short goal kicks while Australia flung more balls from the goalkeeping position to an attacking position.\n\n\nLet us now observe how do the key passes change for each team.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†10: Key passes by Australia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†11: Key passes by Brazil\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon analysing the key passes as illustrated by Figure¬†10 and Figure¬†11, we can make the following observations:\n\nAustralia was able to make more number of key passes in the box as compared to Brazil.\nBrazil were able to make only 4 outfield passes in the box while the other 2 were attributed to corners."
