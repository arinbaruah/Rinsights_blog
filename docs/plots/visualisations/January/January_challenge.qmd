# Description

Imagine visualising data with multiple intersections and unions, making drawing insights from a traditional Venn diagram extremely complex! 🤔🤷

Introducing the __Upset Plots!__ 💡

In this month's visualisation challenge, I was implemented an "Upset plots". This utilitarian plot, while not the easiest to comprehend at the get-go, is incredibly useful for studying intersections within our data. 📈📊

The plot works on a combination matrix and creates the bar plot by summing the frequencies of the observations for every respective combination of observations. ⚙️

Here is my attempt at visualising data on the popular book reads between 1980-2023 where we can observe a trend of book choices with inter-genre content. The visualisation was created using the UpSetR package on R studio.
