# Arindam (Aaron) Baruah

I am currently a final year graduate student of Business Analytics at [Monash Business School](https://github.com/arinbaruah), Monash University. 

With a strong foundation from my academic journey, I bring two years of hands-on experience as a data analyst at [ArcelorMittal](https://corporate.arcelormittal.com) and [Nippon Steel](https://www.nipponsteel.com), where I honed my analytical skills in a real-world setting. Additionally, I've spent two years as a teaching assistant at [The Indian Institute of Technology Indore](https://www.iiti.ac.in), contributing to research and development in the field of metallurgy. 

I'm passionate about leveraging data-driven insights and analytical expertise to solve complex business as well as research challenges. 

Please feel free to go through the links below to learn more about my experiences, skills, current projects and ways to get in touch with me.
